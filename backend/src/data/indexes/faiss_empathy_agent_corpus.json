  "Was this a friend you were in love with, or just a best friend?",
  "Where has she gone?",
  "Oh was this something that happened because of an argument?",
  "This was a best friend. I miss her.",
  "We no longer talk.",
  "Oh ya? I don't really see how",
  "I do actually hit blank walls a lot of times but i get by",
  "Wait what are sweatings",
  "dont you feel so.. its a wonder",
  "i virtually thought so.. and i used to get sweatings",
  "doing good.. how about you",
  "it's quite strange that you didnt imagine it",
  "Im good, trying to understand how someone can feel like hitting a blank wall when they see the darkness",
  "i dont imagine feeling a lot, maybe your on to something",
  "And thats something you should never do, good on you.",
  "What do you mean it hasn't been easy? How close have you come to cheating?",
  "Yea it hasn't been easy but I am proud I haven't",
  "Don't be nervous. Just be prepared.",
  "Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.",
  "I feel like getting prepared and then having a curve ball thrown at you throws you off.",
  "It's hard to stay clam. How do you do it?",
  "Sounds great! So what's your major?",
  "Well pleased. You should be having brains,man!That's a tough course,i hear.",
  "It is computer science. I am very happy of this achievement and my family is very proud.",
  "I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue?",
  "I am sorry to hear that. I hope it turned out to be a blessing in decise.",
  "Yes, it was a complete surprise.",
  "Wow, that must be terrible, I cannot imagine, I lvoe christmas",
  "Wow, I am sorry to hear that, I wish I could make it a better holiday for you!",
  "Since that day christmas has not been a good time for me. As I have no family, christmas is always the worst.",
  "Some days are just days that you never forget. I wish you could as well.",
  "I work remotely, I wish that you could do something like that as well.",
  "Sometimes in life, it is not about performance. Some people just get a shiner spoon.",
  "I do too, it is unfortnuate because, unbiased, I am our best performer, so it is curious",
  "Thats a sweet man, I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture.",
  "Their aren't that many well rounded people in the world these days so when you see one you should always show appreciation!",
  "Yes, I did. I was so grateful because I have a lot of money in my wallet.",
  "What happened?",
  "I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find a better opportunity. Did you know why they rejected you?",
  "Got rejected from a place I wanted to work, not once but three times",
  "Thanks, they gave me the same generic lines you always hear.",
  "WOW! Did it do any damage?",
  "That is great. I would have been scared to death. Was it recent?",
  "No luckily the house was ok.",
  "haha yeah that would be very bad !",
  "Oh no , sorry to hear that happened to you :(",
  "It was, I almost cried cause everyone was laughing at me",
  "What happened for you to feel that way?",
  "Oh that does sound terrible. What did you guys decide to do?",
  "I was at the beach and a hurricane changed track and was coming straight at us. My boyfriend didnt want to leave because we were on the second day only of our vacation.",
  "Well we ended up leaving I was too scared to stay and was really upset.",
  "That's very scary. I hope no one got hurt.",
  "So happy everyone was fine!! Everything else can be fixed.",
  "So good to hear. Might want to trim some trees lol",
  "We were OK, though the tree broke through only a few feet away from my daughter.",
  "Indeed. We were out of the house for five months while repairs were being done, but now the house is better than ever.",
  "I saw that game. They won on penalty kicks!",
  "It was very tense. The other game with England and Sweden was not nearly as nerve-wracking.",
  "Yes! Both countries were not about to let each other win",
  "You're right. I prefer nerve-wrecking matches. When both teams are great, the tension really builds.",
  "It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older?",
  "My aunt does the same thing! I think what she is doing is accidentally deleting texts, and she doesn't understand how to check her contacts list. What do you think is happening with your co-worker?",
  "Yes, she is. She is telling that all the cell phone that she has been using have deleting her contacts.",
  "What is the problem with the engine?",
  "Sorry to hear that. I hope you find what is the problem with the engine.",
  "It has a miss. Sometimes when you are driving it sputters and jerks and barely has any power. Other times it drives just fine. I have replaced so many things on it and nothing makes a difference for very long.",
  "I felt sad and depressed due to my insecurities and felt rejected from society",
  "The problem is I don't think you can grew out of my specific insecurity.",
  "Yes, I felt that way for a while. But then I grew used to the solitude.",
  "I'm not familiar with abseiling, but I'm glad that you felt good about it.",
  "Oh, I see. No, I've never done that.",
  "absailing, its when you rappeling down a building. What have you down that amazing?",
  "so what have you done?",
  "Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home.",
  "I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for. Camping would be a fun one.",
  "I want to look in to getting a nice fire pit for the house.",
  "Funny - we just built a house where we used to go camping when I was a kid.",
  "That's wonderful. Do you have any plans to have a fire?",
  "What kind of house are you building?",
  "That sounds great. What are you most excited for?",
  "I just moved in so it is already built. Just working on planning out decorating and appliances and such.",
  "I think I am most excited for all the space I have. I can have friends over and not feel cramped.",
  "Why did you feel guilty for taking a drink?",
  "I can understand. I am not a big drinker myself, but I wouldn't feel guilty about it. Not unless you promised someone you wouldn't drink.",
  "Oh yea I can understand that then... Well I am sure you learned your lesson, right?",
  "It was not my thing and the moment I took I did wrong. Later in the night I started feeling bad.",
  "Yeah I did to my mum and dad...When I started vomiting I mess my dress and mum knew.",
  "Yeah bad...anyway bye...Thanks for the chat.",
  "Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through.",
  "Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made.",
  "Well I choose to stay and work it out, but I never told him. It has been 3 years.",
  "Well I thought I would be feel better but because I am not the cheating kind, I still feel guilty.",
  "wow, that was so awesome of them!",
  "I had to buy my first car and it wasn't until I was 21 that I could afford it.",
  "Yeah it really was, I am still very thankful of them",
  "That is where I am still at, I am scared I will have regrets when I get older",
  "That is good, I am glad you have no regrets!",
  "I don'",
  "what was the topic",
  "I'm not familiar with him where is he from",
  "and how did you learn about him",
  "It was about the medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer.",
  "He was an English poet in the fourteenth century,",
  "Yes, I think that everyone does! What about you?",
  "That's too bad. Our janitor is very friendly.",
  "yes a few that drive me nuts. the janitor is the worst",
  "she comes in my office smelling like smoke trying to chat it up rather than do her job.",
  "Is it not better you replace it with same type of statuette,at a grocery store?",
  "The mother of your grand mother ,that means your great grand mother ! Well you can search through her archives",
  "No, it is not possible. It is old statuette given by the mother of my grandmother.",
  "What happened?",
  "It is very bad service. What did you do? Did you complain to the manager?",
  "Imagine ,I requested a French fries ,but was served burger instead!",
  "That would be hard to do and take courage.",
  "I could see that happening but sounds like you were super brave.",
  "Thanks man, at the heat of the moment I ate due to my flashbacks I was traumised.",
  "Oh, my, what happened?",
  "I live near the ocean, so I do understand how this can be. I hope you ran, very quickly.",
  "I heard a story of seagulls drowning a man to death.",
  "I was eating some chips on the balcony. I dropped them and then was swarmed by seagulls.",
  "I went inside. I donr know how dangerous they are but I didnt want to fall 7 stories.",
  "I was the same way.",
  "Lol. I take away my daughters now. I guess my mom passed the torch.",
  "She is 13 not at 3am",
  "Now that I am older though, my girlfriend tries to take away my Pc. Very rough days in my life.",
  "Stop doing that, it is very important to have a pc. The internet is the future and very many jobs are opening up online.",
  "I think at 3am the mind is truly it's sharpest and can make great content. I do understand the age thing though. Maybe slowly give her more time as she gets older. At 15 to 16 it gets hard to control all together.",
  "What promise didn't he keep?",
  "Wow that sounds like a terrible friend. I hope he had a good reason for not showing up.",
  "I was suppose to help me move from my apartment. He didn't come and turned off his cell phone.",
  "Wow. Did he have kids?",
  "Ah ok. Good you stayed committed to your wife.",
  "I was the one who was being seduced as the married man. Good thing I remained committed to my wife and did not cheat.",
  "That is very inspiring, I'm glad you take the extra time. Do you like doing what you do?",
  "That is awesome, thanks for taking the time to help kids grasp a new language! You deserve to be appreciated, but I'm sure they appreciate you a lot.",
  "I like it very much, seeing a kid grasp a new concept and very quickly and finding effective ways to do it is a blast.",
  "That is heartbreaking, it's always helped me to remember that no matter what happens, you have your memories with them.",
  "Absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories.",
  "That is true, we got her when I was 3 years old so I kind of grew up with her, I'll never forget those memories.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been frustrating.",
  "Hopefully you were able to get the ice cream that you wanted in the following days.",
  "I just really wanted some ice cream! Now I know their hours, though.",
  "Oh no! Glad your dad was able to help. How did it happen?",
  "That's some bad luck. I hope it wasn't too much of a hassle.",
  "I ran over a nail in the road. Now I know not to drive near new houses.",
  "Awe how sweet, I bet those are good memories",
  "I agree with that for sure.",
  "They are. All the sights and sounds of babies are so precious to remember.",
  "I bet! That sounds like fun.",
  "What sweet memories to hold on to.",
  "It was fun for sure, all the rides and the food, it brings back great memories.",
  "Have you ever been to the amusement park?",
  "That's awesome! How helpful where the other people so that you could enjoy your trip?",
  "Must have been super fun. How were the local people? How did they treat you?",
  "That's great! Im glad that they took care of you! Have a gret day!",
  "My wife was amazing. She booked the whole trip for us, and planned out some things for us to do while we were there. The person's house we stayed at was also really great, and helped us find our way around Auckland.",
  "Super nice, the locals were always willing to help us navigate around, and had great recommendations for things to try while we were there.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what caused it?",
  "I've done that to myself before. Now I always wait awhile to sleep after eating.",
  "Apparently he ate something and slept immediately",
  "Yeah I had to tell him either to sleep first for a bit than eat. Or eat at first and wait an hour",
  "What were you afraid of?",
  "Oh No, well glad to see you are here still!",
  "Two years ago, i was admitted in hospital. I was ill",
  "Luckily",
  "what is your job position?",
  "That's very bad",
  "I do sales work, but he always lies to us and takes our bonus money.",
  "What did you do?",
  "Ouch... Is it just for a day? Is your friend a safe driver?",
  "Yes... If this makes you feel better.. I lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright.",
  "Well, I normally do not feel comfortable lending things to my friends, but recently I mustered up the trust to loan my friend my vehicle.",
  "Well, I have known him for a while and I have never seen him drive crazy, so im just hoping all goes well. It is just for a day, but a lot can happen in a day.",
  "Haha my girlfriend does the same thing. Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.",
  "We all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then.",
  "All women have the same problem. It is a guilty pleasure..",
  "Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on.",
  "Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster.",
  "Especially when it's a time of day that they know will be crowded and busy.",
  "I don't mind those sometimes, sometimes I prefer they do it.",
  "Yeah, or at least do something to correct that.",
  "or hire more people maybe also",
  "They don't spend money unless they absolutely have to. They get bonuses for saving money I think",
  "Maybe there should be a training day where they do back over everything,",
  "That too! If only",
  "And then what?",
  "I understand, that must suck",
  "Its frustrating when I go from 24 an hour to 10 an hour because of his lies.",
  "Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet?",
  "Thats true, but I hope some good luck comes your way soon..",
  "yes i did, but i still can not get that money",
  "oh well, where did you move?",
  "wow!! wonderful isn't!! you would have been over the moon once you moved..",
  "We moved back to our hometown. We were so looking forward to being near family and friends again.",
  "Oh no, that's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.",
  "I am sure that threw a wrench in your plans. How frustrating!",
  "It was indeed. the worst part was not able to get hold of him. He parked and wandered somewhere.",
  "Yeah i missed my movie..",
  "whats your favorite food? that was very nice of them",
  "oh nice, im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies",
  "I know it was rather sweet of them... i love anything asian!",
  "That will mess you up for a few days. The only thing I don't like about going away.",
  "Oh no. Hopefully everybody gets back to normal soon.",
  "I went to bed at a decent time last night. When I woke up my kids were still up watching cartoons!",
  "I only like yard work with the kids. They do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt.",
  "Oh no. The shower is the plus side to all the dirt I guess. I once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower. I quit that day.",
  "The grass makes me itchy, But the shower afterward feels great.",
  "Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day.",
  "That's definitely better than nothing. I hope your days have been better since!",
  "I know right! ..., but atleast I had some amaretto in the fridge.. lol",
  "Thats so special! What a beautiful moment.. How old is she?",
  "My daughter is 1.5 years old - shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their \"first\" moments. Congrats mama!",
  "She is 4. She normally is completely fearless, compared to my son who is afraid of everything. Haha! So I love that she has worked so hard to overcome this.",
  "Thank you, and same to you! I hope you enjoy many happy swimming days with your little princess.",
  "Have you thought about talking to your boss about it?",
  "You should still speak to him about your concerns.",
  "I don't think it is a good idea. There was a layout off six month ago.",
  "This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then?",
  "Did she already move out?",
  "I made them both leave but me and Liz are breaking up.",
  "I asked her to come and pack her bags. Enough is enough I can not do this with her anymore.",
  "What do you mean? I don't know what you are talking about.",
  "Well then I guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt. I hope you called a ambulance.",
  "I heard a noise outside that sounded like a car had wrecked yesterday.",
  "I would have gotten out right then I believe.",
  "I guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath",
  "I still took it since it was late but I rode in the front seat.",
  "It was gross but I was super tired. I only paid half for the ride though.",
  "Wao, that sound like a great strong realtionship you have with her, so glad to hear that!",
  "When my first daugther was born! i saw in new life, i thought everything in the world can change, we need to be pure as kids.",
  "When i see them, i believe thiw world in which we live fill with envy and hate can be rewed",
  "Yeah, thank you! at which situation did you feel hope for your life?",
  "Wow! you're right. We should learn from kids.",
  "Thats good that you found the keychain",
  "that's very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.",
  "Yeah it meant a lot to me - almost like a sign!",
  "That is seriously the worst... waiting around all day wondering whats going on! Have you tried calling him today?",
  "Of course right, I would try angies list or homeadvisor! They can find you a new one...",
  "Oh yeah, and it goes to his answering machine every time.",
  "Thanks I will.",
  "Oh no. I am sure he will get caught eventually though.",
  "Things you do usually come back to you .",
  "Doubtful, but I sure hope so! He gets a 100 dollar bonus every week because of his ways..",
  "What event was taking place?",
  "That's cool you were on stage for that. Were you one of the musicians?",
  "Music. Some of the hardest music that professionals play.",
  "yes i was",
  "Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation?",
  "Sounds rather special to me! Out of the country or to another state?",
  "Nothing special. I just travel to my familly. It has been almost a year that I didn't see them.",
  "That is great. It is sweet to see them grow and learn. How old is she?",
  "Funny one ha ha",
  "Shes 18 months old, it really is amazing to see them develop. If only people clapped for us when we used the bathroom... ha ha",
  "It is so sweet. Is she able to talk?",
  "That should be funny to see and hear",
  "Shes just starting to try to say full sentences, but right now its just a lot of babbling and drooling. lol",
  "That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with?",
  "Well I hope you two can talk it out, express your feelings and work it out together! Friendship is hard to come by these days...",
  "I wanted to wall mount my TV but my friend didn't come and turned off his cell phone. I was always helping him for anything.",
  "Traveling is hard work. Where did you go?",
  "Wow. I have never neen that far! I have been to the Caribbean though.",
  "I went to Peru to visit my family. I try to go every year.",
  "Thats awesome, friends really can be the best. How long have you known them?",
  "Im glad you have such good friends in your life, it makes life easier.",
  "Around ten years. I let my friends borrow my debit card the other day. A stranger wouldve wiped me out.",
  "Yep. Trust them with my life.",
  "Omg... thats terrible! Im so sorry - Ive been through similar. Are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off?",
  "If they have a heart or soul they will! They really should...",
  "I feel like if they go through with it they have to offer us packages right?",
  "Yeah I think a bunch of us are going to meet up after work and talk about it.",
  "That is really cool! Did they tell you why they were giving you the bonus?",
  "Well at least you get something to look forward too at work.",
  "I wasnt expecting it, but basically because my stats were above",
  "What was it. I've been too busy to notice new movies out.",
  "They do put out good movies most of the time. I will try and check it out.",
  "It was called Infinity War! You should find time to see it.",
  "I think the new villain Thanos might be my favorite bad guy ever!",
  "What are they doing to cause you to think that?",
  "I have heard that too. You might want to contact your local district.",
  "No problem I hope everything works out",
  "They aren't clean and I've been getting a lot of mice, and snakes follow them I think.",
  "good idea",
  "Happy Birthday!!!! What are you going to do for it?",
  "I hope you get lots and lots!",
  "Nothing today since its Thursday, hopefully I can bar hop this weekend. Waiting for gifts today.",
  "me too. I love goodies.",
  "Oh no! Bugs really creep me out!",
  "what did the landlor do about it? Did you have to call an exterminator?",
  "me too.. i really was freaking out.",
  "Ugh.. that seems like forever away.. can you try to get it sooner?",
  "Maybe consider looking for a new job in the meantime? Never hurts to stay ahead..",
  "No, I tried everything. It is like betrayed me.",
  "That is nice. I like going to water park. What time are you going?",
  "Is it a big water park?",
  "Its so much fun, really pretty down there too. Oh in a few hours!",
  "Are you ok, you have to tell me what happened.",
  "Ahh that has happened to everyone before. It is embarrassing but you will get over it.",
  "Well im glad you were able to cover up.",
  "I'm fine. Just a litte embarassed. I ripped my leggings dancing on bourbon street.",
  "Yep. My shirt was long enough to cover it. Plus I don't live there lol.",
  "me too.",
  "Oh no. That must have been scary.",
  "Wow. I would've freaked. I can't even have all of the lights out in my apartment.",
  "Glad a bear didn't eat you",
  "I was sitting their for over 6 hours in the dark and night.",
  "Well I finally got a signal and was able to get my brother to come and help me.",
  "How long have you been trying to sell it for?",
  "I'm sure you will sell it soon! 3 months is not such a long time",
  "It's been almost 3 months now, but not 1 offer.",
  "Did you wait a lot?",
  "Ah ok Congratulation",
  "I did. I am going to finish soon though.",
  "Shame on them.",
  "You should report him. Anonymously. You should't have to deal with that every day.",
  "It is bothering me a lot. This coworker is not competent and he spend this time making jokes on other people.",
  "Oh no, that's scary, is she okay?",
  "That's good, I'm glad it wasn't serious.",
  "Yeah it wasnt too bad just a couple scrapes, its hard seeing your kids get hurt.",
  "What are they doing that is upsetting you?",
  "Have you made a formal complaint against them yet?",
  "You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you.",
  "They argue constantly and we live in apartments so I can hear everything. They even call the police a lot.",
  "Yes, but I think they know the landlord.",
  "That happens a lot. What happened next?",
  "I know the feeling. I hate driving now. Everyone is looking in their phone.",
  "I thnk the driving age should be raised to 21 personally",
  "Well I to swerve onto the shoulder and almost caused a accident. Some people are just jerks on the road.",
  "Nothing upsets me more than seeing teenagers on their phones. It really boils my blood.",
  "Please tell me that he was friendly and nothing creepy!",
  "Thank god! LOL I was like please tell me this was a positive experience...",
  "I wouldn't know. I defnitely didn't want to risk it and declined the offer!",
  "Wasn't worth taking the chance to find out on that one haha. But it could've gotten bad, but I'm glad there were lots of cars passing by at the time.",
  "That would pretty amazing. What will you do with the winning?",
  "I think the same really. Making sure everything is paid off, having a roof over your head, etc... is what most people would want to take caer of first.",
  "Pay off my debts from moving number 1, and then buy a house! What would you do with the money?",
  "Good for you! Studying can be a real challenge sometimes.",
  "Awesome, that's the best way to go into exam. I'm sure you'll do great!",
  "Yes, I feel ready. I can't wait to take that exam",
  "That is great. Probably he think that you are doing a great job.",
  "That is good",
  "Yeah, we have always gotten along well, and he has always been very supportive of me.",
  "That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my job once as well and times got really hard. What kind of stuff are you doing to try and avoid that outcome?",
  "Well, at the time I was holding out for a similar paying job like I had before but I could not find one and I ended up working fast food. I had to downsize my place as well.",
  "Thank you. I've been working odd and ends and am looking for a job that pays more of course. How did you overcome that time?",
  "HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Do you have any plans for today?",
  "That is really cool, Where did you guys on your trip?",
  "I live in Texas so that it really close to me",
  "Still recovering from a road trip but hopefully things will get exciting this weekend!",
  "New Orleans IT was great",
  "Cool",
  "Oh no. That's not right.",
  "Lol. Why didnt' you just reschedule?",
  "So you said you were going out of town. That's hilarious.",
  "I told her I had to go out of town and instead I just stayed home all day.",
  "Because We do it everyother day and I did not want to seem lazy.",
  "Yeah I just kinda feel bad about doing it...",
  "wow! That's awesome! Did you accept the job offer?",
  "yes, i understand. sometimes you just get a gut feeling that something isn't right",
  "It sounded too good to be true honestly it made me feel a little uneasy... i had to turn it down!",
  "Bummer!!! Are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job?",
  "I hear ya.. I hope you find one soon... wishing you all of the best!",
  "just any job at this point. just a full time stable job",
  "thank you!",
  "I do that all of time.",
  "Lol. Poor Max. I bet sometimes dogs wished the spoke English for that very reason.",
  "Shame on you. I'm telling",
  "Well my wife confronted me this morning and I blamed it on our dog Max.",
  "Yeah my wife had been kinda cold torwards him since. I feel bad for him..",
  "O wow that is a long time, Are you happy with it?",
  "Im sorry to hear that sometimes people grow apart. You should try to throw a party and see who comes.",
  "It's getting smaller, but my friends used to come over more. Now I'm by myself all the time.",
  "Sounds like a plan",
  "congratulations! I know, it probably feels lonely. Maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours",
  "you can't go wrong with some grilled food :) burgers, wings, hot dogs",
  "That actually sounds like a really good idea! Thank you... now to decide what to cook.. lol",
  "I would have went running like forest gump - what did you do?",
  "Going to have to burn the whole house down now, and move... LOL just joking!",
  "went back inside the house and called animal control. it looked like a copperhead so i'm not messing with them",
  "i totally would. lol i hate snakes and bugs and spiders",
  "Oh no. Did they say why?",
  "Hopefully it might be reconsidered later on.",
  "I guess it just did not get enough funding. It just sucks because it is my favorite movie.",
  "That is what im thinking but you can never tell with these things.",
  "Is she ok? Im glad you were close by!",
  "That is really cool of you to do, Did anyone else see it happen?",
  "She was very alarmed and rightfully so. I'm usually not a nice person, but I'm glad I did the right thing that time!",
  "That's terrible. Employers just don't value their employees sometimes.",
  "I hope so, too. Have you considered working elsewhere?",
  "It seems like it doesnt it.. i hope it gets better.",
  "Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem?",
  "Well glad they didnt freak out on you, some people arent as understanding. I bet it was pricey.",
  "They didn't even know what happened, but I got myself to let them know although I was terribly scared of the expenses.",
  "Why is that?",
  "Well I just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good. Maybe that will work for you.",
  "That's good to hear. Where did you get it from?",
  "I gotcha. I bought mine online too.",
  "I had gained a little weight and got embarassed.",
  "I have one now. I saw a bunch of ladies strutting in their suits and iy boosted my confidence. I had a ball at the beach the next day.",
  "Online. I can't say the store name. I won't allow me",
  "oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. It's hard.",
  "People say it gets easier. I'm still waiting for that part.",
  "I hope so. Nice chatting with you.",
  "Yes it is. She was the grandparent I was closest to.",
  "Yes, I believe that time is the best way to heal.",
  "You as well. Have a great day.",
  "I hear ya. Anyway to get a new job?",
  "Got ya. What kind of work do you currently do?",
  "Ive been trying what I really need is a higher paid one so that way I dont have to work 2 jobs.",
  "I dont like rude people either did you tell him?",
  "Oh god.. give it a few days and then try to sort it out!",
  "I did and then we got into a argument about it.",
  "Oh yeah I am sure it is.. have you talked to them about paying for it?",
  "That really sucks.. i guess all you can do is get a metal type of fence or maybe one with spikes! ( lol )",
  "I'm afraid to unfortunately. They broke the window once, and I had to get police involved.",
  "Wow! Have you been to many places?",
  "I've been in the same place. DC and then its neighbor, MD.",
  "New York, VA, FL... how about you?",
  "MY brothers are the same way. At least yours ginally came around.",
  "two younger ones. They only call when they want something. my older sister is the same. I'm the good one.",
  "haha siblings! How many brothers do you have?",
  "Happy Birthday! Is the call from the ex a good or bad thing?",
  "Exes are exes for a reason I guess lol.",
  "Thanks. It wouldve been a good thing if he didn't call last month to tell me happy birthday also. He should know when my birthday is after 11 years lol",
  "Aint that the truth!!!",
  "That's not good. I know my eyes hurt when staring at the bright white screen on computers . So I change them to a darker color when possible.",
  "Haven't tried that yet, but I have heard of it. I will check it out. thanks !",
  "Oh yes. That is smart. After the warning, I use the screen dimming program called f.lux.",
  "Nostalgia. Is there another HS nearby for the kids to go to?",
  "That's pretty terrible. Thirty minutes in a day pretty much just commuting one way. School is already tough.",
  "Yes, They consolidated and it's awful. The kids now have a thirty minute bus ride one way to school.",
  "I know. We have a lot of snow in the winter too. So it's dangerous also.",
  "Aw thats so nice, how did she surprise you?",
  "Cakes! yessss winning. :)",
  "She showed up to my house and brought me a cake.",
  "Thats too bad. What happened?",
  "Thats horrible. Sorry to hear.",

  "I think to a amusment park but im not sure!",
  "Thank you! I hope you have a good dau.",
  "Did you get hit my it? I bet that was scary.",
  "Im glad you are ok, How is your community.",
  "We did but it wasnt too bad, not as bad as the news made it out to sound.",
  "Wow that's awesome. I went back at 31. Still going.",
  "I am studying Criminal Justice now. Hopefully I will be done soon.",
  "Yea. She's a pretty amazing lady to do that and inspirational of course. What are you in school for?",
  "Did you go through a breakup recently?",
  "Happy Birthday! Well, you can order out of course.",
  "IF two years is recent lol. Today is my birthday and I don't want to cook.",
  "I think I will.",
  "What happened to him? How are they doing?",
  "That is understanable, I would be the same way.",
  "Got into a motorcycle accident and is now paraplegic. They're doing just fine! He's got his pride issues, but she's sticking with him.",
  "Oh man. What happened?",
  "Did you end up getting a ticket?",
  "He said I was speeding but I was really nervous.",
  "No he let me off with a warning.",
  "That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class.",
  "Go to a walking path or park. Maybe to a dog park also.",
  "Thank you. Can't afford outside help unfortunatley. Yes. I have picked up exercising though.",
  "Can't always help unfortunately. I hope the little guy made it, too!",
  "I wonder how they get all the way to the road away from the other turtles!",
  "They're so pitiful with their little heads up , like where are you mom, where did you go.",
  "They come down a mountain and the creek is on the opposite side of the road I believe",
  "I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her?",
  "Usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation... i would get a 2nd opinion!",
  "The doctor just recommended exercise. I'm not sure if they were just busy to do anymore for her or if exercise is the best.",
  "How many hours do you have left?",
  "haha not bad! where are you going on vacation?",
  "4 hours to go! ahhh",
  "Thats great, was the result good?",
  "That's great. How happy were you?",
  "He signed right away and we had a drink to celebrate.",
  "Well lets just say I think im going to get that bonus.",
  "Did it bite you? Are you ok?",
  "Im glad you are ok. Some of those are poisonous and can kill.",
  "Luckily it did not. I was fine just scared.",
  "Wow That's amazing. You must be very proud of her. I think coding, etc, seems very hard.",
  "Very inspirational story. They make good money too.",
  "Yea. I mean I can't even code. And there goes my mom who didn't even know a browser was, now coding!",
  "That's amazing! How do you anticipate dealing with people who are afraid of needles?",
  "That's good thinking. I hope you won't get too many who are afraid!",
  "I would probably tell them to look the other way and that it really isn't very painful.",
  "Or pass out on me, lol. Thanks",
  "Thats good. Make sure you follow up.",
  "That's great. Would this be a good job?",
  "Thank you. I did actually. The recruiter sounded pretty positive on the phone.",
  "Good luck! I hope you'll win!",
  "Well, you never know. It's nice to think what you can do with the money though.",
  "I know my chances are not good but maybe I can get lucky.",
  "I'm so sorry to hear that. How sad for you.",
  "Did he ditch you as well? And how did the girlfriend react?",
  "It is. I've been absorbed in work for the last 3 years and haven't gone out. So I guess everyone kinda moved on without me.",
  "Very nice! Where was the party?",
  "That's really sweet of them. Must've been a big party.",
  "It was held at my parent's house in New Orleans.",
  "Last year my family surprised me for my birthday with a party.",
  "Thats so terrible! :( Im really sorry... you should do something special everyday and make memories!",
  "It really doesnt.. i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful. I really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon..",
  "I plan on it! He is really old so it is just his time to go and I get that but that doesnt make it any easier.",
  "Yeah It is just one of those things we all have to go through at some point.",
  "Did you tell your spouse? I really think they should know.",
  "Some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them.",
  "I havent yet, but I agree with you I should. I just dont want them to be upset with my friends.",
  "I would too. Deff need to.",
  "I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one!",
  "So you can ride in style for free. Sounds fair to me.. until you get yours! :)",
  "I guess so. It is a really nice car.",
  "lol. i like you!",
  "oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.",
  "I don't. My apartment won't allow, but we are moving soon I hope to get a cat.",
  "Thanks, it always sucks when you have to say goodbye.. but shes better off now without pain. Do you have any pets?",
  "Oh, I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too.",
  "I like to try different types of food from other places too. Then try to make them later on.",
  "Yea. It was nice learning about the culture there, and people were really nice.",
  "That can be stressful. I hope you get the sale. What will you do afterwards?",
  "Do you prefer the isolation?",
  "I will move to a less rural area. It's very isolated and you have to have a vehicle for transportation.",
  "No, that's why I'm selling actually.",
  "Awesome! Where are you headed to?",
  "OMG!!!!! That sounds amazing! Its going to be epic. I hope you have a great time.",
  "Japan! Looking forward to the food.",
  "That's really considerate of you. Do they need your help a lot?",
  "Wow. Home selling can be tough. I hope that debt clears up real soon!",
  "Yeah we recently moved so we have gotten in quite debt while trying to sell the previous home! ugh",
  "That's sucks. You just have to warm up to people.",
  "I would be so scared to move to a new place. I commend you. It'll get better",
  "Yea. It's going to take some time. It's just tough going through it right now.",
  "What happened?!",
  "Oh no. Did you end up having to leave the cart?",
  "I filled an entire cart with food for a party and then realized I had forgot me purse at home.",
  "Yes. MY apartment is close by but It was still embarrassing",
  "Do you usually get a live one ?",
  "Just a small fake one. Some people get really into decorating. I don't really like it.",
  "I thought about it, but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one?",
  "That sucks..... always bad to see something like that. Did you atleast enjoy your trip?",
  "Aw thats good! Im glad you still had a good time.",
  "Yeah, I got to see a few people I knew . It was still fun",
  "Thank you . Hope you get a vacation this year too.",
  "surprise party or intervention",
  "How sweet! I hope someone throws me one one day.",
  "It was a surprise party I turned 25. I honestly thought they all had forgotten.",
  "That is exciting and scary all at the same time",
  "I could understand that, Does she know anyone at her new school?",
  "I was more afraid than she was. It was a big transistion. All girls and she is 13.",
  "Not one person. But she did end up making a lot of new friends and doing well in her classes. I am so proud of her.",
  "life was simple then wasnt it! very cute.",
  "I know what you mean. I miss being little myself.",
  "Yes it was so much simpler. We got excited for the smallest things",
  "yes me too",
  "Oh no that is not good",
  "Did you finally find it",
  "I know I was so scared, and nervous.. it almost ruined the entire trip.",
  "That's gotta be terrible. Why did they pick him instead of you?",
  "I'm sorry to hear. Will you have another chance to get promoted?",
  "They made us both take a test. I geuss he scored better than me.",
  "I think we get another chance in the winter.",
  "O im sorry to hear that! How did it happen?",
  "Does he not have a chance to regain his eyesite?",
  "His vision was gradually getting worse. Suddenly, his vision got really blurry one day and they called emergency.",
  "What a beautiful memory that you will always have though... have you tried to be friends again?",
  "I get it.. but you know life really is too short.. i think you should try to reach out! Do it! :)",
  "No. I am too embarassed to reach out to her after all these years.",
  "What happened?!",
  "Oh no. Guess they have finally reached that rebellious age. What did you do?",
  "My child went out behind my back, and snuck out!",
  "I have no idea what that is.",
  "Oh is it and action movie.",
  "It is a old movie that came out in the 80s. I remember seeing it as a kid!",
  "Yeah it is a old black and white Karate movie",
  "What did you do with it? Did you try to kill it?",
  "Thats what I would have done. Did they get it taken care of?",
  "I closed the door and put a towel under it. IT was late so i couldn't call maintenence til thehmorning.",
  "Yes. He had chewed a hole under my sink so they boaded it up and put down traps.",
  "O No! Are they going to offer you any kind of package?",
  "Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you should contact your HR and see what your options are",
  "Doubtful honestly.. they dont seem to care very much. :/",
  "How is it looking?",
  "There you go! Thats awesome.. i really wish we had a garage. lol lucky!",
  "I think we will be able to get two cars in here now!",
  "oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.",
  "OF course. Pets are family.",
  "He is really old but I hate that it happened you know?",
  "What charities do you like to give too",
  "That is a very nice thing to do, I wish I could do more to help.",
  "I just put all my change in a giant bottle.",
  "Whatever my local pharmacy is giving to at the time. I donate my change since I shop there a lot. It adds up.",
  "Every litlle bit counts. Eventually I will be able to write a check.",
  "I hope someone turns it in soon to you.. did you lose out on money too?",
  "Yeah a real pain honestly... im sorry that happened to you. :/",
  "I usually dont have much cash on me but the cards are hard to replace.",
  "Did you buy tickets or win them?",
  "Yeah",
  "I bought them, woulda been cool to win them though right? lol",
  "What game did they win?",
  "Really? I don't recall that at all. I remember them choking. I could be wrong.",
  "The NFC championship.",
  "That sucks. Are you ok?",
  "Thats good. Did the clocks all reset?",
  "The power went out for about 15 and scared the crap out of me, but other than that we were fine.",
  "The ones I have back ups so they never went out.",
  "I bet that was rather fun, how fast did you get it going?",
  "Wow! You are crazy, ha ha - i probably would have had a panic attack at 90MPH. :p",
  "Over 100mph.",
  "Thats great.I change my oil all the time.",
  "Yes my dad taught me also.",
  "I havent changed my oil in years since my dad taught me so... it was an achievement for sure.",
  "Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it?",
  "Dont feel that way... theres someone out there for everyone. Give it a try. :)",
  "Yeah I just feel like it is no use.",
  "OK I geuss I can try to apply myself more.",
  "Were you able to get her help in time! How is she doing?",
  "That is good to hear! Yeah situations like that can be really alarming.",
  "Yeah I was able to get the food unlodged but wow it was super scary. Shes okay now thanks!",
  "Thats not right. How did you feel?",
  "That's good. How did you do?",
  "No we are allowed to bring notes it was just a surprise test. I felt happy about being able to bring mine.",
  "I got a A! the highest score in the class.",
  "Im sorry to hear that. Was it from age or complications?",
  "Yeah that is not good. But everyone does have a time to go you know?",
  "Age but she also smoked.",
  "were you afraid of the dark?",
  "i slept in my mom's room because i was always afraid of the dark",
  "Yes. I had a nightlight to help.",
  "I was. I use to have a nightlight to help.",
  "Did she land?",
  "Sweet. Did the crowd cheer?",
  "Yeah! It was just really fast and she went up really high!",
  "Everyone got on there feet and clapped for her. She had to be only 10 or so.",
  "Wow that is great! When are you going to start?",
  "That is really great! How does that make you feel?",
  "In the Fall.",
  "Why don't you say something?",
  "That isn't nice.",
  "i did, she calls me a helicopter parent and just laughs at me",
  "oh gosh, me too!! especially the clown from the movie IT",
  "i slept with a light on for a couple of night lol",
  "Yes I saw that movie and cried.",
  "That sounds really nice! Did you stay near the ocean?",
  "I remember throwing food over and watching them catch it as a kid.",
  "Yes in Biloxi. The balcony had a downside though. The seagulls would always try to steal your food.",
  "There were like 5 of them trying to steal my crackers. I was scared.",
  "What did it say?",
  "That is so sweet. Give him twenty dollars.",
  "I bet he would love that.",
  "It was from my 7 year old son, He wanted to tell me he loved me and wished he could come work with me,",
  "I think I am going to take him out for icecream.",
  "oh no :( maybe you should confess and i'm sure you will feel better",
  "i understand. maybe next time you shouldn't cheay",
  "I would but I will get in trouble.",
  "Sorry to hear that.",
  "Yes. I have lost my grandma.",
  "Yeah, as you get older you have to face the fact of loved ones not being around forever.",
  "My condolences to you...I hope you have wonderful memories of her!",
  "That is a terrible thing to happen, I'm sure...",
  "I'm happy that you are still here as well! Think of the alternative :(",
  "Yes I was very lucky.",
  "Nice, how was the water.",
  "Thats funny. Did you get them all?",
  "It was a heated ppol so that was nice. But when I jumped in some of may hair extension came out!",
  "Yes luckily no one else was there.",
  "Mw too. I don't even llike when it's too dark inside or outside.",
  "Maybe we are ghosts.",
  "I hope I never meet a ghost.",
  "I live in Texas, We really dont have to worry about them here.",
  "Texas is a great place! But I can understand the need to want to be prepared.",
  "I love Texas.",
  "How much?",
  "Cool. What kind of car.",
  "It was enough that I was able to pay off my car and a lot of bills.",
  "It was a 84 Mustang.",
  "That is terrible, does it smell?",
  "You should tell someone.",
  "no. That's not the problem. Sometimes people leave their trash on the outside and then there are a lot of raccoons out there at night.",
  "I have for 5 years. Everyone should just move awawy and I live here alone lol.",
  "I think it's my turn to win the lottery",
  "Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol",
  "Maybe we can split it if we win.",
  "what did he do?",
  "yes, i can see how it can bbe annoying",
  "He just talks too much.",
  "awww. don't tell anyone but my son is my favorite child. I have two girls also.",
  "How old is your son now?",
  "I won't tell anyone.",
  "I love Halloween.",
  "I love candy.",
  "It is my favorite. I love dressing up with my kids and eating all of their candy.",
  "Where did you meet her?",
  "Thats cool. Will you see her again?",
  "We meet online on a dating site. I was nervous but I did not let it show and took charge.",
  "We have plans to go out next week!",
  "I bet! It has to feel like a huge accomplishment.",
  "I did not know you had a 4.0! How do your parents feel about that.",
  "Yes and I had a 4.0",
  "Nice. Did you take it?",
  "Nice did you take it?",
  "I definitely did!",
  "Good luck! Do your best. you sound well prepapred.",
  "I hope you get it!",
  "I expect an A.",
  "I'm not actually in America so I don't share the same joy as you :p",
  "That's always the positive side of hitting rock bottom right?",
  "Lol. There is no joy here. But I think the only way to go is up now.",
  "That's terrible. Do you think they'll take care of it>",
  "Hope you don't end up in court.",
  "No. They went pretty quiet.",
  "I think that's the usual for kids. How old is she",
  "That's kind of funny though. How did she react?",
  "13. I ate her dinner yesterday because she just refused to get up. I feel bad about it now",
  "she went to bed lo",
  "You should never lie to them. What did you say?",
  "Did your friend do something bad? Why were they looking for them",
  "I said I did not know where my friend was.",
  "Nice. Which one?",
  "That should be fun.",
  "Well they have one near my job. My son a Jack really wants to go so I am taking him.",
  "Yeah he has been talking about it all week long!",
  "oh, did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach",
  "you miss your buddy, huh",
  "Yea. I enjoyed it alot. That's why it made me think of my buddy.",
  "I do. Makes me angry.",
  "I do not like Krystals.",
  "We ordered Krystals on a road trip and couldn't even take it back because it would have cost too much time on the road. I was so upset.",
  "I don't anymore.",
  "Did he have a weapon?",
  "What were you gonna do if you caught him?",
  "Yes but only a small knife.",
  "Oh no! Were there a lot of lines you had to remember?",
  "Oh wow, thats impressive but I don't blame you for forgetting lines then since there were probably tons.",
  "Yes. I was the main character.",
  "Wow! Have you looked to see how much it is worth? You could have some money.",
  "You might want to talk to a financial adviser about it.",
  "It's enough to pay 1 year's worth of mortgage. Wondering if I should sell it or hold now.",
  "Did you find it?",
  "I'm sure everyone has lost something. They're just probably glad it wasn't them.",
  "I did but the entire office was watching me the whole time. I hated looking stupid like that.",
  "Yeah i guess it was still very annoying. I think some people laughed at me.",
  "That's awesome. Do you think you will get it?",
  "Yes, definitely. Do you plan on buying anything new?",
  "I hope so! It will help finances a lot.",
  "What did you think about?",
  "glad to hear you had such a carefree childhood. do you have siblings?",
  "I just thought about how easy and carefree life was when I was a child. I was never alone and always had something to do.",
  "I have younger brothers that are 7 years younger than I am so I was an only child for awhile.",
  "That's terrible. Wh don't people just leave insteading of hurting their partner. I don't get it.",
  "ME too. She wasn't the right one obviously. Sucks to have put in so much time though",
  "I don't get it either. I hope he can move on.",
  "I watched the first season.",
  "What? It's ending? I heard he hasn't yet finished the books.",
  "I love that show. I'm sad it is ending. It should stay on forever.",
  "Nest season is the last. I was hoping it would last forever like the simpsons.",
  "I agree. I love autumn.",
  "I love Memphis.",
  "It gets do hot in memphis. My daughter is ready for school to start back anyway,",
  "Me too! Been here all of my life.",
  "It is a passing grade. I would be fine with it.",
  "A guess an A would've been nice then since you worked so hard.",
  "Yes I studied hard to pass.",
  "That's good. Preperation is the first step in having a good presentation.",
  "Fingers crossed, I hope the presentation goes well.",
  "Yea. I hope we didn't miss anything. We spent a lot of time on it.",
  "That's exciting! Cabin sounds really cozy.",
  "She's a lucky lady!",
  "Yeah, we haven't gone on a romantic vacation in over a year, so I'm really looking foward to it.",
  "That's the worst, I know how that feels, I'm kind of being ghosted right now myself.",
  "Just remember that means it was most likely for the best that she did ghost you, you wouldn't want to be with someone like that anyways.",
  "Aw that's awful, I wouldn't wish that on anybody. She was laughing and all smiley and everything, I can't imagine why she ghosted me.",
  "Awww. Do you ever go back and visit?",
  "Where is rou hometown?",
  "I havent been back yet but maybe I will in the winter so I can experience the snow again.",
  "I bet you are excited... are you bringing anything over with you?",
  "Sounds yummy! Thats a good choice. Have a great time.",
  "A bottle of moscato. She likes that.",
  "We will.",
  "What kind of rock would you want to be?",
  "So a dwayne rock.",
  "The actor The Rock.",
  "/Did you get him a teacher?",
  "I would be proud of him also.",
  "I took him to get evaluatd and we are waiting for a spot to open at school. I practiced at home with him non stop though and now he won't shut up. I'm so proud of him",
  "I knew he could do it. Moms always overreact.",
  "You? I thought I was dreaming",
  "Well, no use crying over silled milk I say.",
  "Yes, Big upset.",
  "I feel your pain, that happened to me a few years ago, I ended up having to settle on a job I didn't like just to make ends meet.",
  "I hope you find a job, good luck!",
  "Its a scary situation to be in but like you I almost pretty much applying to anything out there!",
  "I'm doing pretty alright, what about you?",
  "Absolutely, it is one of my biggest pet peeves, especially when people accuse me of lying too.",
  "I have been better, I just am kind of annoyed with lying. Does lying annoy you also/",
  "Yea, its the worst. Especially when someone lies to you and you forgive them, but that little bit of anxiety is always in you thinking \"what if they are lying now again?\".",
  "I really wish I could NOT correlate to that. But I can. Me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face. It is a terrible feeling, and I know exactly what you are talking about. If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it, better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime.",
  "Yea, recently I have been trying to decide whether or not I want to mute my girlfriend on social media or not, like not block her, just mute her. Because it bothers me how she acts single on social media, and it confuses me as to whether she wants to be with me, or is just trying to live a different personality online. Because she talks to me and is all lovey-dovey, then gets on social media and talks like \"I don't need anyone\" and talks about how hot guys are. And it leaves me so stuck and with the worst anxiety.",
  "That's so terrible to hear about. Do girls not understand that men also want to be valued over some random guys that they meet or even just see on the street? It's crazy to me that they are so rude sometimes.",
  "Was your history test hard even after all the studying?",
  "That's good, did you end up passing then?",
  "Yes but I was prepared.",
  "Thats great. Where did you meet?",
  "What did you eat?",
  "We met yesterday at this restaurant and just had some good conversation, ate some food, and caught up with each other's lives.",
  "Some garlic bread, some hot wings, and a few slices of pizza.",
  "Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan, so what was so big about this?",
  "Never once? Damn, no wonder you were so shocked by it!",
  "It had never happened before.",
  "Yes, when does the season start?",
  "That's exciting, who's your favorite team?",
  "August, Can't wait.",
  "Do you regret it now that you are?",
  "Why are you worried still?",
  "No, but I am still worried.",
  "oh no. How long has she been gone.",
  "I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry, but she was fine.",
  "well I hope your cat returns safely.",
  "you too",
  "two days. I live by a road , so I'm afraid she'll go in that direction.",
  "I've seen a lot of animals killed on the highways. Its so sad.",
  "thanks , nice chatting with you",
  "Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place.",
  "Keep on the lookout and talk to realtors. They usually hear of good places first",
  "We aren't supposed to, but I did anyway. Got to make the best out it.",
  "How was it?",
  "Thats great. Where did you go.",
  "Beforehand I was really nervous that I was gonna mess it up and make things awkward. Contrary to that it really wasn't too bad!",
  "This Italian restaurant and an escape room too.",
  "I worry about that too occasionally, but I just push it to the back of my mind like usual.",
  "I'm sure it won't be, most people die of old age around their friends and family in a peaceful way so just hope for that.",
  "I hope mine isn't painful.",
  "I am, I like the Oilers, who's your favorite team?",
  "Nice, I hope they do well this season.",
  "I love the Leafs.",
  "Oh, all kids are a little iffy, I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children?",
  "Teenagers are awful! I am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager....not.",
  "My mom put \"the curse\" on me. She said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than I did. If that's the case, I need to start saving for boarding school, because I was awful!",
  "Good luck!",
  "My oldest is 13. She is the worst. But my 2 and 3 year old are perfect lol",
  "lol. she is upset about everything all of time. I couldnt have been that way lol",
  "That's hilarious. Maybe II was terrible too then.",
  "So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. I'm saving for a new car instead.",
  "Makes sense. I don't want any more bills until my kids are in school. Daycare is very expensive.",
  "of course the 13 year old hates to babysit. I can't wait until she moves out. jk",
  "This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!",
  "It's still a work in progress, but we tested the transmission before we put it in. It works wonderfully and came out of a car that only has 90,000 miles on it, versus mine that has 200,000. I would like to get a new car, but I don't want to take on another payment until my house is paid off.",
  "Yes it is! Especially for two!",
  "Of course she does! Lol that's hilarious, but I know how hard teenagers are so it's kind of almost serious too.",
  "What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that.",
  "That's terrible. There are so many things to be afraid of when you're pregnant!",
  "It's basically when eclampsia has progressed to the point that your blood won't clot and your organs start shutting down.",
  "I absolutely hate car issues. Will you be getting it fixed or buying another one?",
  "Did it have any warranty when you bought it?",
  "I'm saving for a new one. I didn't even have it a year.",
  "Nope. I bought it cash from obviously a snake oil salesman.",
  "Why are you alone so much in the summer?",
  "Do you have friends around? Go to a bar and meet some friends!",
  "My wife goes to Canada to visit her mom.",
  "Was it as you remembered it?",
  "That is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled. They seem to throw way too many buildings away these days.",
  "It was exactly the same! I was super surprised that no renovations were made, the same playground and buildings and everything.",
  "I know that feeling too, at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me, but maybe I'm wrong.",
  "That type of stuff always makes me so angry, since it's so clearly favoritism and hypocrisy and they just don't care one bit.",
  "She always says \"If I didn't buy it for them, they wouldn't have it\". But it's a bit ridiculous because my sister in law DOES have the money, she just refuses to raise her own children.",
  "I like football, who are you talking about? what team?",
  "Oh i see! are you excited with him? do you think they can go for the super bowl?",
  "The Falcons and their new defensive coach.",
  "I know that feeling! Are you involved in any political or activists groups?",
  "Me neither. But I agree with your sentiment - it is a great place to live and be a part of!",
  "No I am not.",
  "Yes. I do not have any kids myself.",
  "Yes. Grandkids would be fun.",
  "We have two now and they are both almost grown - time for grandkids I guess!",
  "oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence?",
  "who's cookies were they?",
  "Yes. I ate it quick.",
  "Do you study?",
  "Thats good. Where do you go?",
  "I do now. I passed all of my classes last semester, so I think I;m back on track.",
  "University of Memphis",
  "Interviews can be nerve wrecking.",
  "I think if you stay calm you'll do fine.",
  "Yeah, I'm definitely excited for it",
  "Yikes, that must of been a bit scary. How did it go?",
  "That's something at least. I hope they catch him.",
  "Yeah, I have a friend who has gone through the same situation. She just wants whats best best for her kids. I hope things get better for you.",
  "The other party didn't show up so they put out a warrant for him. I don't have to go back now.",
  "They always do and then we start all over again. It's sad.",
  "It shouldn't matter what you look like, but why would you think you are fat?",
  "It doesn't mean you are fat or overweight. Everyone is different.",
  "I weight more than I should.",
  "I watch it sometimes, It can be a little slow moving for my taste.",
  "Are you from New York area. I'm a little farther south, but I do like them for sure.",
  "I love the Yankees.",
  "I hate jury duty.",
  "Yes. They underpay.",
  "It can be an inconvenience and it only paid 12 dollars a day. So that was bad.",
  "really bad.",
  "Yes, so are you having nice weather,or is it too dry and need some rain?",
  "I see. Well, maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future? I like sunshine, but know we need some rain too, hope you get some soon.",
  "Yes we need rain.",
  "oh no! that's scary! The house didn't get flooded, right?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that!",
  "Not this time. But it did a little bit in 2009. and the mud and mess was unbelievably hard to clean up.",
  "You get very stressed out , like post traumatic stress disorder when it starts raining lol",
  "That's actually so frustrating! No note left on your car or anything from the other driver?",
  "Sorry to hear, I really hope that it doesn't cost to much to fix that up.",
  "No! That's the worst part. I can understand if someone left a note to say sorry. But no :(",
  "Thank you, I really appreciate that. Makes the situation a little more bearable.",
  "Oh no, that really sucks. That's awful that she wanted to end things, especially since you were really into her. I am sorry.",
  "That's really odd, and unfortunate. Thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better :) Don't lose hope!",
  "It's fine, I'm feeling a lot better about it. The thing that irks me is that she went from super happy about dating to literally ending it and ghosting me in so little time. Makes me think it was all fake, but I can't think why she would do it.",
  "Thats sound nice. I went on vacation to Thailand last week. What did you do?",
  "I know what that feels like. It must have been exciting!",
  "Acting as a 'mentor' in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better!",
  "We went to Disney world with some friends who had never been before. We are passholders so we have been several times, but it was fun getting to see it throught the eyes of someone who had never been before.",
  "We had a great time! We both have small kids so they loved playing together, and it was nice to get to help show our friends the ropes and all the 'secrets' lol",
  "It is for me. I am very type A, and getting to plan and coordinate everything is right up my alley!",
  "Oh no, was it an important meal?",
  "That's so sad! What did you end up doing instead?",
  "What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?",
  "Yes, it was my nephew's birthday party pizza. And I promised him I would make his favorite pepperoni pizza!",
  "We had to order from a fast food chain! It wasn't bad, but fair to say, my nephew was disappointed in me.",
  "It left in the oven and was distracted by my boss",
  "Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it?",
  "I am sorry to hear that. Flying is never easy, especially when you feel that stressed",
  "I was not able to cope with it. I had a severe panic attack.",
  "Who is she?",
  "That is bad. Did you bought her a good present so she can forget about it?",
  "My cousin, she really wanted me to attend her party since she enjoys my cooking and I had planned on making cookies",
  "That does sound scary! Were you okay?",
  "Understandable, it must have been very unexpected!",
  "I did end up being okay, but man was I nervous and shaking",
  "That can be a fun time, it is nice to watch kids sometimes",
  "I love playing video games, I am sure he really enjoyed that, even I would have!",
  "I agree. We just played xbox and had snacks. I feel he really enjoyed his time.",
  "Nice, I am glad to hear about that",
  "How old is he?",
  "Yeah, it was vey exciting news, I'm so proud of him.",
  "Wow, that's terrible. Why would he do that to you?",
  "I'm sorry you're having to go through that, I hope you're able to sell the home for a better price.",
  "That's just terrible. Some people really are ungrateful.",
  "Well, hopefully he'll learn to be a better person someday, or eventually his actions will come back to haunt him.",
  "I have no idea, I guess his husband is evil",
  "me too, and do you know what makes me mad? When I had a good job, I helped them a lot, and now they are trying to do this to me",
  "I know, right? My own nephew trying to do this with me",
  "I know that feel, my brother graduated a year ago, it's a really big milestone.",
  "Yes I agree, it really signifies the start of their next chapter in life.",
  "It is, somewhat common, but still, I am proud of him all the same!",
  "That must have been a burden lifted for sure!",
  "That must have been a burden lifted for sure!",
  "It really was, I was scared I would fail but I ended up passing all my classes and even doing well in most of them, I was over joyed.",
  "That's a shame, since rain is really nice to watch and hear even disregarding the dryness over there.",
  "Very true, well hopefully you get some anyway!",
  "Yes, It has its drawbacks too, like making the grass grow, lol",
  "Yeah, we have to have it sometimes.",
  "That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem in ones self I believe.",
  "I hope you he changes some so you can still be friends.",
  "That wouldn't surprise me. He has always been a bit insecure.",
  "that's wonderful! i've never cheated on my husband either",
  "it is :( i don't know how is it possible to cheat on someone you love",
  "That is good and sadly rare these days",
  "I am sure you can, it just takes dedication and effort is all!",
  "Then you should have no problems at all!",
  "yes, and i'm very motivated",
  "that is so scary! you didn't get hurt, right?",
  "i'm so glad you did'nt get hurt",
  "I was a fast kid so I got away, but I had heard how hard they bite",
  "Me too, that would have been brutal",
  "I was also excited. In fact, I have one right now!",
  "Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime.",
  "That should be fun. Pokemon is a great franchise. I have many of the handheld games.",
  "Awesome, I have Zelda, Mario, Splatoon, Fortnite and tons of other games!",
  "Me neither, too bad it is far away, but we still get smash and Pokemon this year!",
  "I have not, I did hear that England lost recently though.",
  "I heard they were doing great before the loss though, hope you at least got to see them in some good matches.",
  "Yes, I was devastated to learn that because England are my favorite team!",
  "Yes they were doing alright and I was impressed by some of their matches.",
  "Oh no, sorry to hear that! Were you okay?",
  "I can imagine. Well atleast you can look back and laugh it off as one of 'those' days!",
  "Yeah, I was fine. I bit embarrassed, but fine. Had to go home and change though. It was huge mess.",
  "Did this make you excited?",
  "What type of car was it?",
  "I was very excited, just to have a car at all is awesome!",
  "I am sorry to hear that, maybe things will work themselves out!",
  "I feel bad, I hope you find someone who treats you even better!",
  "I hope so to, never thought this would happen, we were suppose to get a house together.",
  "Thank You, I hope I will also, because I deserve it, and so do you.",
  "That sounds embarrassing, what happened after?",
  "That sounds like what I would have done too",
  "I got laughed at a lot and sat down haha",
  "What a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?",
  "hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?",
  "you should let him know now.",
  "When I was younger my dad scared me and my brothers so bad I almost peed myself!",
  "No, I was too young, I just about cried though",
  "I loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so I understand how you feel.",
  "I was very close to mine. They are like parents but more fun.",
  "Thank you, I hope nothing ever happens to them!",
  "That is scary, what are you going to do about it?",
  "Wow that is sad, I hope you get that fixed",
  "I don't know. I had a cute beaver and there was just a head and eyes left of some small animal that looked like him left in my yard. ugh.",
  "thanks",
  "That's fun, my friend is getting married next year, how big was the wedding?",
  "Oh I see, well that's still nice!",
  "Not too big, maybe 30 guests. He and his now wife have been together for only a year or so, so they set the whole thing up pretty quickly.",
  "That is very sad, did he ever get sober?",
  "That is so great, I hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger.",
  "Yes he finally stopped drinking a few years ago, I was very proud of him and was able to have a real relationship with him.",
  "Wow, that's quite a move. Did he say why he's staying in Samoa so long?",
  "I can understand that. It's hard to say goodbye to a friend, I hope you can stay in contact with him.",
  "I think it's because he dropped out of school here and doesn't have much reason to stay in America, since he can start a new life over there. Kinda makes me sad though, I didn't expect it at all.",
  "Oh man that's a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value, or was it really expensive or what?",
  "That might be a good idea, even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt.",
  "It was fairly expensive. She wasn't relly using it for anything, and hasn't noticed it's gone. I think I'm going to buy a replacement for her, and let her know I broke the old one.",
  "Wow that is terrible, I hope he got to live a long life before that happened.",
  "Thats terrible, at least he wasnt a puppy I guess.",
  "I can imagine you would be, wouldnt want that to happen again.",
  "Crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.",
  "He was a little over 8 years old so not long enough!",
  "Yes that's true. Now I am A LOT more careful about where I put rat poison.",
  "No, and it happened very fast. I started seeing symptoms and he died the next day even after I took him to the vet.",
  "How did he manage to do that?",
  "I mean you said he barely passed it though. Must have been slim pickings when it came to giving out the sholarships.",
  "What college did he end up going to?",
  "Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career.",
  "Its mainly an English based test and hes really good at english",
  "Yea he was about 1 point above the cutoff, I was quite jealous of him to be honest, I barely didnt make it sadly.",
  "OU, he ended up dropping out to pursue writing about a year and a half in and wasted the scholarship.",
  "Did you get it done?",
  "Oh, nicely done, thats impressive!",
  "I felt super confident that I'd get the 31, and thankfully I was right since I got a 33!",
  "That is really awful. Did they take very much?",
  "I bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal. Friends should be more trustworthy.",
  "About $50, they even confessed and paid me back, but it was still depressing they didnt just ask first, I wouldve given him the money.",
  "Oh no, did it end up okay?",
  "I'm glad to hear it turned out okay.",
  "I suppose so, I much needed tooth is repaired now so my anxiety really was for nothing.",
  "Wow, it's a wounder you did not get killed!",
  "Do you have any lasting damage?",
  "I was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks. So I know how it is.",
  "Dude the doctor and my parents thought the same thing.",
  "Nah, I did have shards of glass on me for a couple of days even after taking showers.",
  "It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate ,I bet.",
  "Strange they ask you to pay for college, but offer few choices.",
  "Definitely. It was just some random guy, and he was really incompatible with me too so it was really frustrating that they didn't room us together.",
  "That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it, ultimately.",
  "Yeah, it's a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now.",
  "Absolutely, and the time taken to becmoe experts on home repair is rather large.",
  "I did too, honestly. I have really improved them myself, good to hear that you have too.",
  "Although I still deal with stress occasionally, I know exactly what you mean.",
  "Yeah, being a lot calmer is nice and well less stress really.",
  "Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun.",
  "I can see that, i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age.",
  "It does, but I had never tried anything like drugs or alcohol before so I didn't know what to expect.",
  "I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too",
  "Remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything. Being with someone isn't everything, be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it :)",
  "Exactly, I am happy for him but I can't help but feel that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I hear about it. Still kinda makes me feel like a bad person.",
  "I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.",
  "That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.",
  "I beat someone way more popular, that is what made it surprising to me",
  "I would not, they have to learn at some point!",
  "I get that, but it was bound to happn at some point",
  "Yes, but there are other ways to discipline them then yelling. I hurt their feelings.",
  "That is true, especially when I'm not feeling well.",
  "You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it?",
  "No way -- THAT'S the best. Paid for (I'm assuming) *and* running. Do you hope to do the same for your kids when it's time?",
  "I still own it actually, still running!",
  "Damn, I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion?",
  "Cool, 16th birthday or what?",
  "my birthday!",
  "what did you do?",
  "that was the right move!",
  "I was way too close to my girlfriend to do anything, so I just let her know that I was in a relationship so that she wouldn't get the wrong idea.",
  "That's impressive, sounds like a smart young man.",
  "Sounds like it, Good for you guys!",
  "Thanks, I'm really proud of him. We homeschool so I guess I'm doing something right!",
  "Ahh yes, must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it?",
  "Well thats one way to get your kids to do household chores!",
  "I didn't get Mario until late was Sonic adventures 2, Parents hid the console in the bathroom with the game and told me to go clean the bathroom.",
  "What athletics did you participate in?",
  "Man i know that feeling. But sounds like you worked hard.",
  "The runner's marathon. I felt so proud when I came in second place because I had trained for many months for it!",
  "When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him.",
  "I graduated that year too! Cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was.",
  "2017, I was there, it was awesome!",
  "I am very sorry to hear that, that must be terrible....",
  "I undertand that. People are crazy like that, I never understood it",
  "It wasn't a great time, but it just really irked me since I had no idea that she was not into me at that time. She must've been really good at faking it.",
  "That is something I want to do when I get older, I miss the golden days!",
  "I bet it was, to catch up after awhile, few things really compare",
  "You should, especially if you truly miss any of your childhood friends. It was a surreal but amazing experience.",
  "That's tragic, I haven't had to deal with anything like that yet.",
  "I hope so too, and I hope that you don't have to deal with anything like that anytime soon.",
  "I am happy for you, I hope that continues",
  "So your saying your faithful and love her.",
  "Sounds like you got your priorities straight good man.",
  "Absolutely, not even a doubt",
  "Wow, go you! I am proud of you, it can be tough to do!",
  "That is what matters, best of luck using it friend!",
  "Yeah it felt tough every year that passed but i got that degree man.",
  "That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship.",
  "I am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she reciprocates your desire to never cheat.",
  "I agree, I am not sure how people can do that to each other",
  "How exciting, are you from France?",
  "When did she move out there?",
  "No, I am not. It is exciting. It has been almost a year since I saw her.",
  "Great. How long did you stop working out?",
  "It is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.",
  "It's been over 10 years since i've worked out!",
  "yes i did and i have slowly gotten back into it.",
  "Was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65?",
  "The question is, did the woman at least do a good job ( from what you could see)?",
  "No, but I do hate those, too! We were in bumper to bumper traffic, and this woman is putting on her makeup. She doesn't notice when the car in front of her moves, and we miss the light. Ugh!",
  "LOL! Not my place to judge. I was so hopping mad about having to sit through that stupid light again.",
  "How did you respond after rejection?",
  "Yes, you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise",
  "Well it took some time for me to cope up because I really put a lot of efforts, however I got to understand that it should be rather taken as a learning experience",
  "True, and guess what ! Next morning I got a call from a company which I least expected.",
  "I am sorry to hear that, I hope things turn around for you soon!",
  "I am glad to hear that, I hope they work out for you!",
  "Thank you! I'm working through it and I have come up with several solutions to this debt problem.",
  "Thank you so much! I think it will all work out!",
  "HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them?",
  "LOL It really shouldn't be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh! I guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around! haha",
  "I ate their wings and so it was kinda hard to hide because my fingers were orange.... whoops",
  "omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future",
  "All the best for your future and your role aswell!",
  "Thank you, I appreciate it!",
  "You are right.Florida is a big state with lot's of people.",
  "The odds must be astronomical, almost like winning the lottery.",
  "It sure is, what are the odds...",
  "I am shocked too, Croatia only has 4 millio people",
  "Yeaah they really were, number 12 killed it with that goal",
  "Did you watched the game? The Croatians were warriors out there.",
  "That goal took them to the world cup final",
  "I feel that man, Parents like that care for their family a lot.",
  "I am in that boat at times where i live.",
  "Yeaaah, I know a lot of people who struggle with bills.",
  "I know that feeling, good for you!",
  "Yes, those are awesome feelings, I crave that all the time",
  "You ever just get those moment where you shake it off and the confident feeling flows in.",
  "well he did have a right to be angry (depending on how you broke it ofc)",
  "oh darn thats just abit rude and unnecessary. I hope everything is ok now",
  "Yeah he did but i felt bad cause he threw the fax machine into the kitchen. This was a heavy machine by the way.",
  "I am glad to hear that, did you repay him?",
  "That is good to hear, I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster",
  "Yeah i did. I have visited him once i was up and running. He was so chuffed see me breathing",
  "God's grace it did worked out well. We became buddies over the time",
  "sibling fights worth living for.. I wish i had one.",
  "you would know better hehe!!",
  "I am glad I do, I just wish they could shutup sometimes haha",
  "Well happy early birthday! I hope you have a great day!",
  "I bet, I hope you get everything you want!",
  "Thanks. I can't wait for tomorrow for the party and the presents",
  "Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now?",
  "Great.",
  "I do luckily, and a great girlfriend, so things work out in the end",
  "Good job! I am sure that took a lot of hard work!",
  "I am sure that was stressful that whole time",
  "You have no idea. I have been waiting 3 years for that promotion.",
  "Me to. I also play gameboy from time to time",
  "I do not have mine.I bought one on EBAY and also 12 games just to remember the past",
  "I still have my one from when I was young, it is in good shape",
  "That is so aggravating! I've been in the exact same situation. I hope you weren't hurt.",
  "Good to hear you were all right. Hopefully insurance covered your car -- though I know nothing makes up for the time spent dealing with the situation!",
  "I was okay, but my car got a bit messed up",
  "I believe this kind of a rude attitude by parents leave an impression on the kid's growth",
  "True, I have a close friend who's quite young now and he seems to have scary thoughts about his childhood days",
  "I turned out okay, but for some people it certainly might",
  "I wish I could afford lessons or to even try, I bet it is really fun!",
  "I do like to watch it in the olympics or sure though!",
  "Yeah it's an amazing experience altogether. I really enjoy the sport.",
  "During last winter Olympics, my country did really well in the sport !",
  "I like them too. I like to play football games while I'm eating Chik-Fil-A, but I always want to go on Sundays when they're closed.",
  "I never think about it during the week, the craving always hits me on Sunday. It's very disheartening when you pull up and the place is completely empty.",
  "I feel that one deep in my core, I want it ten times more then",
  "That sounds like fun! What are you planning to do at the lake.",
  "It will be a great escape from regular life, right? How often do you get to go?",
  "I'm planning to relax, maybe even swim, sit near the water. I love swimming!",
  "I haven't been to the lake for like a year so it's going to be a lot of fun. It's definitely going to be an escape from the daily life.",
  "Oh that's nice, you must have a hard-working husband.",
  "That sounds horrible. Was it serious?",
  "Yes! Unfortunately, while working on the fence, he grabbed a board with a rough edge and cut his hand.",
  "Not too bad, just needed a band-aid.",
  "That sounds like fun! Was it your first time at Universal?",
  "I can imagine! Were there any other memorable aspects of the visit?",
  "Yes! it was indeed my first time there even. So that was even more exciting.",
  "Those are both admirable ideas. How are you trying to improve trust?",
  "Travel agents make complicated travel so much easier than using online sites.",
  "That's awesome. Best of luck to you with your business!",
  "I talk about my business to everyone at meetings and why it's important to use a travel agent and not go with the cheap guys online.",
  "We do! It's very time consuming looking on line. Even with the cruise lines I'm going to get better deals and better cabin space for a client",
  "Thank you very much!",
  "I'm sorry to hear that! Happy Birthday! Hope you didn't eat the entire cake LOL!",
  "I decided not to celebrate birthdays anymore now that I'm old!",
  "Maybe next year will be better!",
  "I wish! I did enjoy a good dinner, but it would have been nice if others were around to celebrate.",
  "Well, I like to think of it as an excuse to meet friends and family. Too bad I was away from family that day!",
  "Oh my goodness! That must have been frightening. What happened after it alerted?",
  "Where did the snake go?",
  "It took me a minute to figure out what I was hearing, and then I back up VERY quickly!!",
  "It stayed put. My friend and I had to backtrack, and cut through some heavy brush to get around it, because the trail was too narrow to walk past it on.",
  "That is awesome! I bet you had a great time!",
  "Weight loss can be so liberating! I'm glad you were able to enjoy yourself.",
  "I did! I was celebrating having lost 20lbs! At first I was nervous, but then it was fun.",
  "That's awesome. Is she better?",
  "That's scary! How old is she?",
  "Yes, she is. She having issues with her heart. She needed a chirurgical operation.",
  "Same. It is just a devasting thing that is happening.",
  "That is true. But this is basic humanity you know. Surely there is another way",
  "Yes, it is.This problem in the border is very complex and emotive",
  "When what happened?",
  "What was the issue that plagued you?",
  "When I was applying to physical therapy school.",
  "There was no issue that plagued me.",
  "Damn, that sucks. What field do you work in?",
  "Why did he get the promotion over you?",
  "I work in Banking and insurance. I have more experience than him.",
  "That's such a nice gift! What are your main uses of it?",
  "I've heard great things about Reddit but have never actually signed up myself!",
  "Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit.",
  "That's not good at all. Did you lose any important data?",
  "I would be too! That sounds like a real inconvenience.",
  "I lost a lot of my data i used school at the time. I was really mad at him.",
  "I will send all the good vibes! Is it in a field you could see yourself making a career of?",
  "Always, it is. And it sounds empty to say \"it will all work out for the best\"....but it will! In the meantime, are you applying/interviewing for other positions?",
  "No, it is unrelated to my career field and temporary work. Thanks for the good vibes. Waiting to hear back from an interview is nerve racking!",
  "What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of?",
  "I see where you're coming from.",
  "They are to defensive.Their games are so boring.",
  "I'm not too familiar with Tennis, Is he known to be a winner?",
  "Wow that's neat! Crazy to hear he lost then as you said.",
  "He is the best player ever.He won the mos grand slams titles.",
  "What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was?",
  "What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?",
  "It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America, do you agree?",
  "Oh, okay, well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesn't apply here.",
  "We did! We were living in Japan at the time, and we were paying this clinic 2000 yen a week so we could keep getting ultrasounds of the baby.",
  "At the time, the exchange rate was about 110 yen to the dollar, so it was pretty affordable, and worth it to keep going back.",
  "I wouldn't be able to tell you, since I wasn't under their healthcare system. This was just a women's clinic that offered this service pretty cheaply.",
  "Moms are good at doing that, aren't they? What did she do for you?",
  "I know that feeling! What's been getting to you?",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you make a speedy recovery!",
  "She offered to help me out financially with something that was really stressing me out.",
  "I fell off the back porch steps and broke my wrist. It required surgery.",
  "Thanks! I feel like I am. I have double up on milk consumption haha..",
  "yes, especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work?",
  "Where do you go the most?",
  "That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries",
  "Yeah, it's mainly for client site assignments that I have to travel !",
  "It's always interesting to travel to Europe or the Western countries because you have a lot more to do! However quite often I have been travelling to Africa as well.",
  "Wow ! that sound's really awesome. I wish I could have gone there. But surely not for work !",
  "I wish you all the best pal ! You will surely rock !",
  "This is my first time going there. I want to try my luck",
  "Maybe something in your life makes you very stress. You should try to relax before go to sleep.",
  "You konw, sometimes consulting a psy is a good investment. Dont be afraid to do that.",
  "Possibly, my dreams are often very confusing and or lonely. It is very sad. I think I need a lifestyle change, or am just too stressed at night.",
  "That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that.",
  "Huh, I see. Well good for him!",
  "Not sad at all. He was so happy, but of course a little bit anxious.",
  "What happened?",
  "Oh, no. That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job?",
  "Yeah, that's good. It's hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. I'm glad that it sounds like it worked out.",
  "Yeah, navigating those sorts of things is treacherous, but as long as you know you're doing the right thing, that's all you can do.",
  "They tried to make out I was bad at my job, that's the last time I'll give somebody a heads up at my own expense again.",
  "I sure did, thankfully I've been there a lot longer so they know me well enough.",
  "It did, but it could have ended very badly for me or even have resulted in me losing my job.",
  "That can be pretty hard to swallow, do you stay in touch? It's easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void?",
  "That's such a shame, we grieve any kind of loss, I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together?",
  "I hope it works out for you, life is too short. Fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen.",
  "We don't really stay in touch anymore. He and his fiance invited me to their wedding, though. He's not a social media person, and I'm not either, so we've basically lost touch. I haven't filled the void, unfortunately, but I feel okay about it now.",
  "Maybe it will. I'm not sure, but I feel more happy for him now than I do envious and hurt. So, whatever happens, happens. It's okay.",
  "I'm not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape!",
  "Yes, I'm aware, but i'm a much bigger hockey fan.",
  "The world is the biggest sports competition worldwide, right after the Olympics.",
  "I do not like to watch hockey.You can't see the puck.",
  "I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American.",
  "How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe? You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here.",
  "It's sad that you have such a small mind.",
  "It's coming form a traitor, you mean",
  "I do not care about other parts of the world.I care about how my country treats immigrants.",
  "It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you?",
  "You must have felt terribly guilty when you realized! Happens to all of us",
  "Yeah when i was going to drive friends home i thought they were in my car at first but they wanted to ride on our way to the next place we were going.",
  "Brain just wants to work against you?",
  "I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments.",
  "Yep, basically my brain just abandoned me at the critical moment. I was so disappointed.",
  "Oh, man. That's rough. I'm sorry. Are friends helping?",
  "Friends I know who have been through rough breakups often say that physical activity helps. That, and time. But still -- it's difficult!",
  "They are trying, but they all are in relationships right now, so it is very difficult.",
  "Holy smokes - thats unbelievable. I gave up on playing those scratch off games",
  "How often do you play?",
  "I know! I normally do not win so I could not believe it when I did!",
  "Were you using it to get to a specific place?",
  "I hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going.",
  "yes, I was traveling to my daughters new house",
  "I am hopeful as well, but because we are human beings, I doubt that will ever happen. There will always be the same old squabbles that have occurred since the dawn of man.",
  "Yeah, sadly our world leaders are too focused on \"flexing\" instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and liveable for our grandchildren's children",
  "True, just don't like how the world is inching toward a conflict that could spill over to a nuclear war.",
  "Exactly, its truly very sad times at the moment",
  "That's sad. Sorry you had to go through that.",
  "I would have peed in my pants if i was there.",
  "Well i started hearing footsteps and voice it was so scary.",
  "How do you feel now after so long being there?",
  "That is a great feeling i bet! Good job man!",
  "It feels amazing to know that I've surpassed people that thought I would fail.",
  "That must have been terrible. Were you okay?",
  "I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK.",
  "At first, there were no supplies. But yes, we ended up OK.",
  "Thanks.",
  "Yes, many. Would you like to tell me about it?",
  "Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.",
  "Well if you're curious, I was on my way to work when my car broke down and I ended up missing a very important meeting about my promotion. I was devastated.",
  "That is terrible. Were you able to do anything about it?",
  "Did you speak to a counselor, priest, or family member about it?",
  "No, it was terrible period for me. There was sometime that could sleep a full night.",
  "That is terrible. Did you feel lonely?",
  "How long did you stay alone?",
  "Yes. I tried distracting myself with tv and internet, but i kept thinking of them.",
  "Till they returned home. It was really a fairly bleak experience, and one which i am not anxious to repeat.",
  "That is pretty great! I am actually still a beginner with snowboarding.",
  "I feel for me it's just getting to the slopes more often too.",
  "I believe the sooner you start the better it is ! It also depends upon your passion for the sport.",
  "Yeah true. When did you start?",
  "True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up",
  "Do you have a professional degree in first aid?",
  "Yeah, I think the most important thing to me is the first aid kit.",
  "Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat?",
  "I know what you mean. It's like you have to dress for both the outside *and* the inside. That's great you have a pool in which to escape, though!",
  "No I hate you can't do anything outside and are trapped indoor its not nice. The only thing that I do is swim in my pool and cool off.",
  "Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!",
  "Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!",
  "Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.",
  "None of my or the landlord's insurance covered the damage, so he's paying for the repairs out of pocket.",
  "Not really, the repairs were supposed to take three days, and it's taken over three weeks so far.",
  "Were they fond memories?",
  "That's understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!",
  "Yeah, most of the were. I think we forget the awkward stuff. On the other hand, I'm not sure I would want to do it again.",
  "Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic?",
  "I'm so sorry you had to go through that.",
  "Yes, the image keep coming back. Terrible.",
  "Sorry to hear about that. Did you ask him to move out of the house?",
  "Did you know the person who was with him?",
  "No, we are working on sorting things out but I am still very hurt.",
  "Yes, unfortunately",
  "What song was it? Did you know it?",
  "Man that is crazy! Especially that song!",
  "Yeah it was Ride the Lightning by Metallica, which made it even more impressive because it's a very technical and fast song.",
  "I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too, it's very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes.",
  "Yeah, sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves.",
  "Yeah, you sorta feel like the specialist among your friends and loved ones.",
  "Did you take that chance and redo it?",
  "I hope the email will bring you good news",
  "Not yet I'm still waiting for the email with the new info",
  "I know that pain! Did he keep you up watching tv or video games?",
  "Because mine does the same thing... If its not video games its the TV on full blast haha! Tell him you need your beauty sleep.",
  "Video games! How did you know?",
  "So have you gotten to open it yet??",
  "Wow! I would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.",
  "Yep! I was hoping it was a special award that my company give to deserving employees. Turns out it was just some HR paperwork that she needed to go over with me regarding my team. Boo!",
  "Oh no! Well what he didn't know won't hurt him. Hopefully you can get a replacement.",
  "Awww well I am glad he was understanding about it.",
  "Unfortunately he walked in right as I took the last bite! Fortunately it all worked out so no harm done.",
  "Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us.",
  "I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?",
  "So you all had relatively all his life. Yes, it was the right thing to do. Did you get another pet instead?",
  "He was 15 and his kidneys were failing. It was really hard for me and my kids.",
  "Since he was 4 months old. It was so hard, but the right thing to do.",
  "Wow! You must have a very trusting face! That was very nice of you to help her.",
  "It definitely was! How old do you think her kids were?",
  "I like to help others! It was not an easy thing to do, but it seemed like it was the right thing to do.",
  "I think once was 4 and the other was 2. I helped her with the 4 year old.",
  "I almost don't want to talk about it, you know? Are you doing anything to try to move from a place of fear to one of preparation or opportunity?",
  "Good for you. And I hope you have moments of joy while you prepare for that?",
  "yes. I am saving all i can for when the storm comes.",
  "I don't get to have moments of joy in those situations.",
  "Did you play it?",
  "That sounds so fun! I\"m glad you enjoyed it!",
  "I did. It took me back to my childhood.",
  "When i was a child, i would steal dollars from my brother's coin collection and go to the arcade.",
  "I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight.",
  "Please tell me that you gave him some money to help him out.",
  "I was empathetic. It also make me feel thankful for my blessings.",
  "That's unfortunate. Do you like her?",
  "I am sorry. Did you set up another day to hang out?",
  "Of course, she's my best friend. I just feel bad that I had to bail on her for the third time in a row.",
  "I'm taking her out to breakfast when she gets off work Sunday morning. Time to see what this IHOB is all about!",
  "What did you and your friends do on that day?",
  "That does sound fun! Was the food good?",
  "We went to a new restaurant none of us had ever been to. It was fun!",
  "Oh no, did you report it to the police?",
  "I have some hot chocolate that can help calm you down a bit.",
  "Yes, I did but I am still shocked.",
  "No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything?",
  "I am so sorry! But he does sound like a true friend if he's actively paying you back!",
  "Well I had insurance, but he was driving so it wasn't covered. He's been paying me back bit by bit.",
  "That is exciting when your team wins, have you always been a hockey fan?",
  "That is awesome! I am from Chicago, so when the cubs won the world series I felt the same way.",
  "Yep since i was 3! Was a nice time the streets of DC flooded with people celebrating a championship finally for the team.",
  "I bet! always good when new life is born.",
  "Oh that must be a handful for your parents.",
  "Yes, she is the first granddaughter in our family. Every one was excited to finally have a girl after all boys.",
  "I am sorry to hear that.I hope she gets better.",
  "That is horrible news.Your family should make sure she gets comfortable on her last moments.",
  "She won't. It is stage 4 liver cirrhosis. I'm pretty distraught about it.",
  "Wow I did not know that!",
  "Oh no. Were you upset as well?",
  "It was a huge upset.The England team was the favorite.",
  "No.I do not care about England.",
  "Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments, I think it's how we respond that defines us, you know?",
  "Probably even harder! Is there another fellowship you have your eye on?",
  "Oh, sending you all the best vibes! And congratulations ahead of time, Doctor!",
  "For sure! Last year I was really hoping to get this one fellowship but it didn't pan out...but I got back up and kept on working hard!",
  "Not for now, decided to finish up my PhD...it'll be tough but I think I can be done in 1 year or so!",
  "Oh really? How did that make you feel, honestly?",
  "I can imagine. The unknown can be very scary and make you worry.",
  "It made me feel very scared not knowing what would happen.",
  "Oh no! Was it a first date? Or had you been out with this person before?",
  "That's so sweet. Do you laugh about the situation now together?",
  "It was a third date! But now I have been with her for the past 2.5 years :) So it wasn't too bad!",
  "Yep we have definitely told the story to a bunch of our friends and just laugh about it!",
  "Customer :I had a great day at work today! We are working on some pretty complex accounting, and I've had to do a lot of prep at night. Agent :",
  "Customer :There are many different variables that need to be taken into account-- things that I don't usually deal with on a day to day basis. But my extra prep at night has made it so that it's seeming easy. Agent :",
  "Customer :That's really awesome, what makes it so complex? Agent :",
  "Customer :Well that's really great that you were able to prepare so much, obviously you know what you're doing! Do you usually have to prep so much? Agent :",
  "Aww! That's so sweet! How long have you been married?",
  "That's very exciting! Congratulations on your raise!",
  "I went to work and got a big raise. I rushed home to tell her.",
  "When i got home, all of the furniture, my wife and kids were gone.",
  "Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!",
  "You almost gave me a heart attack with that story!!",
  "I did! By one leg! Three inches before his head hit the tile! I almost had a heart attack!",
  "That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion?",
  "Well, now you know they do! That was very thoughtful of them.",
  "My birthday. I didn't even think they liked me.",
  "Where did you see it?",
  "I bet, what did it look like?",
  "My bedroom! I was horrified!",
  "What made it so difficult?",
  "Did you tell the teacher then we know atleast you had tried.",
  "Well I think the teachers in my state don't care enough to teach in a way that I understood.",
  "Wonderful! Your team I guess? That's exciting!",
  "It's great you give them the respect for that, your team or not! When is the Final?",
  "It is exciting. It is not my prefered team but I like the way they play.",
  "What is it about?",
  "Sounds like you will likely do well. Do you expect any problems with other people?",
  "it is for a major project that I am leading. I am fairly well prepared, but I just don't know for sure how it is going to go.",
  "That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.",
  "You're right, and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?",
  "I remember those cars! How long did it last you?",
  "It was so geb=nerous and unexpected. Im sure you can give in ways people will love.",
  "A saturn",
  "That is such a stressful thing to come home to!",
  "I am so sorry you had to go through that!",
  "Yes. Not only did I have to pay $1400 for a new one, I had to throw away all my food.",
  "Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family?",
  "I'll bet. It's always nice to visit, but it can be hard to say goodbye.",
  "Yes I did. It made me think of the past. It was bittersweet.",
  "You still remember what you got for it? It must have been memorable! What was it?",
  "Oh I know that feeling! My family was the same way, and I still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same SNES box sitting on my bed.",
  "It sure was. It was a Super Nintendo which was epic because we were very poor back then.",
  "Oh wow, what time did you end up getting to bed?",
  "I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight.",
  "Probably just before 6am, and I had to wake up for work at 9:30, so needless to say, I called out this morning.",
  "I hope so, too! And no beer tonight!",
  "You shouldn't think about death! Take each day as it comes",
  "Thinking like that seems stressful",
  "That is riduculous. Death is inevitible.",
  "Of course, but unavoiable. Death is not really the concern, but dying.",
  "Life is like that. It is not what you know but who you know.",
  "No need to kiss butt. Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it's terms.",
  "yup, guess I need to practice my butt kissing",
  "What battle? What were you doing?",
  "Is that a video game?",
  "I was playing 1v1 Starcraft on the competitive ladder.",
  "That's never fun. Did you have any notes to help you remember?",
  "That wasn't very nice of them. It's quite common to forget things. Hopefully next time you remember!",
  "No I did not, and everyone laughed at me. It was terrible.",
  "Wow, I'm sure it will work. I've very hopeful for you.",
  "My wife and I have been together for 12 years, tried years ago and nothing. Waited a while and then started trying again and we got it. Fate has a funny way of working out.",
  "Thank you. Seems like I've been trying forever with no success.",
  "That is great. With who are you going?",
  "That is great.",
  "I went with a bunch of people from my school.",
  "Wow. What do you think will happen?",
  "Well make sure you listen to your Dr.'s advice!",
  "I am afraid that I could have some sugar issues.",
  "Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum?",
  "I am sending you all the best vibes. Is it in a field you've worked in before?",
  "Happily, a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry, they'd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects; you can't always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!",
  "I'm so excited! But a little scared too. I hope I get it!",
  "Thank you! It's a customer service job, which I've done, but in a different industry.",
  "I've been in that boat. What do you think the issue was?",
  "That stinks. I've been interviewing also. I had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer. So I feel ya. Just keep looking.",
  "Its hard to know. If I had to guess I couldnt unfortunately.",
  "how did that go?",
  "Was it a long move?",
  "It went ok, i was tired after",
  "Not really no",
  "Why didn't you have any friends?",
  "What games did you play at the time?",
  "Well i was socially awkward due to my learning disability at the time. I would also just sit at my computer and play games."
