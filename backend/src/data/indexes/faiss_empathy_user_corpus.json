  "I have never cheated on my wife.",
  "Yea it hasn't been easy but I am proud I haven't",
  "And thats something you should never do, good on you.",
  "Job interviews always make me sweat bullets, makes me uncomfortable in general to be looked at under a microscope like that.",
  "I feel like getting prepared and then having a curve ball thrown at you throws you off.",
  "Don't be nervous. Just be prepared.",
  "Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.",
  "Hi, this year, I was the first over 300 students at my enginering school",
  "It is computer science. I am very happy of this achievement and my family is very proud.",
  "Sounds great! So what's your major?",
  "I lost my job last year and got really angry.",
  "Yes, it was a complete surprise.",
  "I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue?",
  "During christmas a few years ago, I did not get any presents.",
  "Since that day christmas has not been a good time for me. As I have no family, christmas is always the worst.",
  "Wow, that must be terrible, I cannot imagine, I lvoe christmas",
  "Wow, I am sorry to hear that, I wish I could make it a better holiday for you!",
  "My coworker is allowed to work remotely, but I am not...",

  "I work remotely, I wish that you could do something like that as well.",

  "Thats a sweet man, I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture.",
  "People get rejected all the time but it shouldn't be an excuse to let it dissuade you from reaching your goals.",
  "Got rejected from a place I wanted to work, not once but three times",
  "What happened?",
  "I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find a better opportunity. Did you know why they rejected you?",
  "I had to board my entire house when the hurricane was coming.",
  "No luckily the house was ok.",
  "WOW! Did it do any damage?",
  "Once when I was in preschool, my pants fell down in front of the whole class, I was so embarassed",
  "It was, I almost cried cause everyone was laughing at me",
  "haha yeah that would be very bad !",
  "I never thought things would go like this.",

  "What happened for you to feel that way?",
  "Oh that does sound terrible. What did you guys decide to do?",
  "What a difference a year makes. Last year one evening my family was at home when a tree fell on the house and broke through the ceiling.",
  "We were OK, though the tree broke through only a few feet away from my daughter.",
  "Indeed. We were out of the house for five months while repairs were being done, but now the house is better than ever.",
  "That's very scary. I hope no one got hurt.",
  "So happy everyone was fine!! Everything else can be fixed.",
  "So last week we were watching the world cup, and lo and behold, Croatia beat the host country, Russia",
  "Yes! Both countries were not about to let each other win",
  "I saw that game. They won on penalty kicks!",
  "It was very tense. The other game with England and Sweden was not nearly as nerve-wracking.",
  "Hi, I have a co work always asking me questions about how to use her mobile. It is almost always the same questions.",
  "Yes, she is. She is telling that all the cell phone that she has been using have deleting her contacts.",
  "It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older?",
  "I worked on my truck all weekend. Spent $215 on parts and a special tool. Still did not fix the miss in the engine.",
  "It has a miss. Sometimes when you are driving it sputters and jerks and barely has any power. Other times it drives just fine. I have replaced so many things on it and nothing makes a difference for very long.",
  "What is the problem with the engine?",
  "I found myself divorced a few years ago, and for the first time in my life, I was living alone.",
  "Yes, I felt that way for a while. But then I grew used to the solitude.",

  "That's wonderful. Do you have any plans to have a fire?",
  "Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home.",
  "I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for. Camping would be a fun one.",
  "Planning out my new home has turned out to be a blast!",
  "I just moved in so it is already built. Just working on planning out decorating and appliances and such.",
  "What kind of house are you building?",
  "That sounds great. What are you most excited for?",
  "I never took a drink before and my friends were all over me to take a drink",
  "It was not my thing and the moment I took I did wrong. Later in the night I started feeling bad.",
  "Yeah I did to my mum and dad...When I started vomiting I mess my dress and mum knew.",
  "Why did you feel guilty for taking a drink?",
  "I can understand. I am not a big drinker myself, but I wouldn't feel guilty about it. Not unless you promised someone you wouldn't drink.",
  "Oh yea I can understand that then... Well I am sure you learned your lesson, right?",
  "I was only married for 4 weeks when I learned my husband was having an affair and ongoing after the wedding. I got him back by sleeping with a close family friend. I felt guilty and ashamed because it was out of character.",
  "Well I choose to stay and work it out, but I never told him. It has been 3 years.",
  "Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through.",
  "Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made.",
  "When I was working my first job, my parents picked me up in my new car, I was very surprised, i thought I was gonna have to buy my own car",
  "Yeah it really was, I am still very thankful of them",
  "wow, that was so awesome of them!",

  "Hi, I broke a statuette offered by grandmother to my sister. It was a very important object for my sister.",
  "No, it is not possible. It is old statuette given by the mother of my grandmother.",

  "What happened?",
  "I left his house, filled up with his food and disgust. I left his fridge completely empty and feel guilth",

  "Oh, my, what happened?",
  "I live near the ocean, so I do understand how this can be. I hope you ran, very quickly.",
  "When i was younger, my mother would always take away my PC because I would always play video games on them.",
  "Now that I am older though, my girlfriend tries to take away my Pc. Very rough days in my life.",

  "Lol. I take away my daughters now. I guess my mom passed the torch.",
  "She is 13 not at 3am",
  "One of my friend didn't keep this promise he made to me. I was so angry to him.",

  "What promise didn't he keep?",
  "There were times where I was being seduced by a coworker of mine as a married man.",
  "I was the one who was being seduced as the married man. Good thing I remained committed to my wife and did not cheat.",
  "Wow. Did he have kids?",
  "I am an English Tutor for Chinese students, when they struggle with a topic, I always take extra time to help them along and make sure they understand",
  "I like it very much, seeing a kid grasp a new concept and very quickly and finding effective ways to do it is a blast.",
  "That is very inspiring, I'm glad you take the extra time. Do you like doing what you do?",
  "Have you ever had a pet that you had to put down? I was so heartbroken when my dog of 16 years had to be put down. this was years ago but it still makes me sad to this day.",
  "That is true, we got her when I was 3 years old so I kind of grew up with her, I'll never forget those memories.",
  "That is heartbreaking, it's always helped me to remember that no matter what happens, you have your memories with them.",
  "I drove to Dairy Queen but it was closed.",
  "I just really wanted some ice cream! Now I know their hours, though.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been frustrating.",

  "My kid's birthday are coming up again. It always makes me remember them as babies.",
  "They are. All the sights and sounds of babies are so precious to remember.",
  "Awe how sweet, I bet those are good memories",
  "When I was a little child my parents told me that we were going to the amusement park and it made me so happy",
  "It was fun for sure, all the rides and the food, it brings back great memories.",
  "I bet! That sounds like fun.",
  "What sweet memories to hold on to.",
  "My wife and I decided to go on an iternational trip last year, and it was my first trip out of the US. It was an amazing experience, and one of the best and most memorable things I've ever done.",
  "My wife was amazing. She booked the whole trip for us, and planned out some things for us to do while we were there. The person's house we stayed at was also really great, and helped us find our way around Auckland.",
  "Super nice, the locals were always willing to help us navigate around, and had great recommendations for things to try while we were there.",

  "What did you do?",
  "Ouch... Is it just for a day? Is your friend a safe driver?",
  "I went shopping yesterday and bought a $2000 bag. My husband is going to kill me..",
  "All women have the same problem. It is a guilty pleasure..",
  "Haha my girlfriend does the same thing. Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.",
  "I hate to be tired and see a store crowded with customers and only one or two checkouts open.",
  "Especially when it's a time of day that they know will be crowded and busy.",
  "Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on.",
  "Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster.",
  "There was a person who had to do twice the amount of work that they usually do. Sounded like they need to fire whoever didn't do their job",
  "Maybe there should be a training day where they do back over everything,",
  "That too! If only",
  "Yeah, or at least do something to correct that.",
  "or hire more people maybe also",

  "So after I left the club last night I noticed the Taxi had old throw up in it still.",

  "Is she ok? Im glad you were close by!",
  "I am so sick of my job not paying us for the proper amount of hours!",
  "It seems like it doesnt it.. i hope it gets better.",
  "That's terrible. Employers just don't value their employees sometimes.",
  "I was mowing the lawn, and a rock flew and broke my neighbor's window.",
  "They didn't even know what happened, but I got myself to let them know although I was terribly scared of the expenses.",
  "Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem?",

  "I had gained a little weight and got embarassed.",
  "I have one now. I saw a bunch of ladies strutting in their suits and iy boosted my confidence. I had a ball at the beach the next day.",
  "Online. I can't say the store name. I won't allow me",
  "Why is that?",
  "Well I just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good. Maybe that will work for you.",
  "That's good to hear. Where did you get it from?",
  "My grandmother passed away unexpectedly a few years ago.",

  "Exes are exes for a reason I guess lol.",
  "I went to the optometrist, and my prescription got strong. She warned me about being at risk for losing my vision.",
  "Oh yes. That is smart. After the warning, I use the screen dimming program called f.lux.",
  "That's not good. I know my eyes hurt when staring at the bright white screen on computers . So I change them to a darker color when possible.",
  "My old high school is being sold and turned into an old people's apartment complex. Sad to see it go.",
  "Yes, They consolidated and it's awful. The kids now have a thirty minute bus ride one way to school.",
  "Nostalgia. Is there another HS nearby for the kids to go to?",

  "Thank you. Can't afford outside help unfortunatley. Yes. I have picked up exercising though.",
  "That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class.",
  "A little baby turtle was crossing the road the other day and I was in a hurry and didn't stop and help him. I hope he made it. I usually stop and take them to a creek away from the road. Darn!",
  "They're so pitiful with their little heads up , like where are you mom, where did you go.",

  "Yea. I mean I can't even code. And there goes my mom who didn't even know a browser was, now coding!",
  "Wow That's amazing. You must be very proud of her. I think coding, etc, seems very hard.",
  "I finally finished my Phlebotomy class . It was an hour's drive one way, but thankfully it's over and a hospital nearby is hiring I heard. Whew!",
  "I would probably tell them to look the other way and that it really isn't very painful.",
  "That's amazing! How do you anticipate dealing with people who are afraid of needles?",
  "That's good thinking. I hope you won't get too many who are afraid!",

  "A friend tried to get me to go out to a bar and hang out behind my spouses back...",
  "I havent yet, but I agree with you I should. I just dont want them to be upset with my friends.",
  "Did you tell your spouse? I really think they should know.",
  "Some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them.",
  "I hate being envious, but I've needed a car for months and my friend just bought a new one.",
  "I guess so. It is a really nice car.",
  "I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one!",

  "Just moved here for work, and I don't know anyone. My coworkers have families of their own.",
  "Yea. It's going to take some time. It's just tough going through it right now.",

  "It was for science but I had notes i had brought.",
  "No we are allowed to bring notes it was just a surprise test. I felt happy about being able to bring mine.",
  "Thats not right. How did you feel?",
  "That's good. How did you do?",
  "My grandma died. I am so sad.",
  "Age but she also smoked.",
  "Im sorry to hear that. Was it from age or complications?",
  "I use to hate the dark when I was little.",

  "were you afraid of the dark?",
  "i slept in my mom's room because i was always afraid of the dark",
  "So I was at cheeleading last night and this girl did a double backflip!",

  "oh gosh, me too!! especially the clown from the movie IT",
  "I took a trip over the weekend where we stayed at a nice hotel with a balcony overlooking the pool.",

  "I love Halloween.",
  "So I went to pick up Lucy last night for our date. I was very polite and nice.",
  "We meet online on a dating site. I was nervous but I did not let it show and took charge.",
  "Where did you meet her?",
  "Thats cool. Will you see her again?",
  "I am so happy I graduated college.",
  "Yes and I had a 4.0",
  "I bet! It has to feel like a huge accomplishment.",
  "Got asked to my boss' office. Thought I was getting bad news but turns out I was offered a promotion.",
  "I definitely did!",
  "Nice. Did you take it?",
  "I have studied and am sure I will pass the test.",

  "Don't you hate when you order food and it is terrible.",

  "Yes. I was the main character.",
  "Oh no! Were there a lot of lines you had to remember?",
  "I got stock from family a long time ago. I just let it sit there. It's risen 10 times since.",
  "It's enough to pay 1 year's worth of mortgage. Wondering if I should sell it or hold now.",
  "Wow! Have you looked to see how much it is worth? You could have some money.",

  "We have a work presentation coming up soon. I think we've got everything to present.",
  "Yea. I hope we didn't miss anything. We spent a lot of time on it.",

  "Hi, how are you?",
  "I have been better, I just am kind of annoyed with lying. Does lying annoy you also/",
  "I'm doing pretty alright, what about you?",
  "Absolutely, it is one of my biggest pet peeves, especially when people accuse me of lying too.",
  "I had the worst time last week. I went with my girlfriend to see one of her friends and she talked to him with so much more energy and passion than she does with me.",
  "That's so terrible to hear about. Do girls not understand that men also want to be valued over some random guys that they meet or even just see on the street? It's crazy to me that they are so rude sometimes.",
  "I really wish I could NOT correlate to that. But I can. Me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face. It is a terrible feeling, and I know exactly what you are talking about. If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it, better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime.",

  "We met yesterday at this restaurant and just had some good conversation, ate some food, and caught up with each other's lives.",
  "Thats great. Where did you meet?",
  "What did you eat?",
  "I can't believe the Falcons blew the Super Bowl. I was there.",
  "It had never happened before.",
  "Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan, so what was so big about this?",
  "I love football, are you ready for the season?",
  "August, Can't wait.",
  "Yes, when does the season start?",
  "I was apprehensive to get married.",
  "No, but I am still worried.",
  "Do you regret it now that you are?",
  "I let Daisy my cat out the other evening and she didn't come back home.",
  "two days. I live by a road , so I'm afraid she'll go in that direction.",
  "I've seen a lot of animals killed on the highways. Its so sad.",
  "thanks , nice chatting with you",
  "oh no. How long has she been gone.",
  "I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry, but she was fine.",
  "well I hope your cat returns safely.",
  "my apartment is terrible.",
  "We aren't supposed to, but I did anyway. Got to make the best out it.",
  "Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place.",
  "I know it seems late, but I'm 19 and I went on my first date only about one month ago.",
  "Beforehand I was really nervous that I was gonna mess it up and make things awkward. Contrary to that it really wasn't too bad!",
  "How was it?",
  "Thats great. Where did you go.",
  "I am scared of how I will die.",
  "I hope mine isn't painful.",
  "I worry about that too occasionally, but I just push it to the back of my mind like usual.",
  "I love hockey, are you ready for the season?",
  "I love the Leafs.",
  "I am, I like the Oilers, who's your favorite team?",
  "I think I have some pretty decent kids. May be too soon to tell though.",
  "My oldest is 13. She is the worst. But my 2 and 3 year old are perfect lol",
  "lol. she is upset about everything all of time. I couldnt have been that way lol",
  "That's hilarious. Maybe II was terrible too then.",
  "Oh, all kids are a little iffy, I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children?",
  "Teenagers are awful! I am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager....not.",
  "My mom put \"the curse\" on me. She said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than I did. If that's the case, I need to start saving for boarding school, because I was awful!",
  "My transmission went out in my car at the worst possible time. No way could I afford to get it replaced or rebuilt. My dad was able to loan me $500 to get the new transmission, and my step dad was able to put it in.",
  "It's still a work in progress, but we tested the transmission before we put it in. It works wonderfully and came out of a car that only has 90,000 miles on it, versus mine that has 200,000. I would like to get a new car, but I don't want to take on another payment until my house is paid off.",
  "Yes it is! Especially for two!",
  "Of course she does! Lol that's hilarious, but I know how hard teenagers are so it's kind of almost serious too.",
  "So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. I'm saving for a new car instead.",
  "Makes sense. I don't want any more bills until my kids are in school. Daycare is very expensive.",
  "of course the 13 year old hates to babysit. I can't wait until she moves out. jk",
  "Had HELLP syndrom with first child. Spent all 9 months being pregnant with 2nd child worrying about the same thing happening.",
  "It's basically when eclampsia has progressed to the point that your blood won't clot and your organs start shutting down.",
  "What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that.",
  "MY car has been down for about a month. Every time I leave the house I see all brand new cars.",
  "I'm saving for a new one. I didn't even have it a year.",
  "I absolutely hate car issues. Will you be getting it fixed or buying another one?",
  "Did it have any warranty when you bought it?",
  "I am always alone in the summer.",
  "My wife goes to Canada to visit her mom.",
  "Why are you alone so much in the summer?",
  "I was feeling really ambitious the other day and I decided to drive into the parking lot of my old elementary school just to see all the things I used to see years ago.",
  "It was exactly the same! I was super surprised that no renovations were made, the same playground and buildings and everything.",
  "Was it as you remembered it?",
  "My sister in law basically lives off of my mother in law and her kids get everything. My mother in law rarely gives our kids anything because we have the money to do it ourselves - and I get a bit miffed at times.",
  "She always says \"If I didn't buy it for them, they wouldn't have it\". But it's a bit ridiculous because my sister in law DOES have the money, she just refuses to raise her own children.",
  "I know that feeling too, at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me, but maybe I'm wrong.",
  "I really like the new football coach.",
  "The Falcons and their new defensive coach.",
  "I like football, who are you talking about? what team?",
  "I am so proud to be an American.",
  "No I am not.",
  "I know that feeling! Are you involved in any political or activists groups?",
  "We tried for a baby for a long time, almost 4 years. Waiting those 9 months to meet her were so hard!",
  "We have two now and they are both almost grown - time for grandkids I guess!",
  "Yes. I do not have any kids myself.",
  "I feel bad I stole a cookie from the cookie jar.",
  "Yes. I ate it quick.",
  "oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence?",
  "I had been doing poorly in college for a while.",
  "I do now. I passed all of my classes last semester, so I think I;m back on track.",
  "Do you study?",
  "Thats good. Where do you go?",
  "I've got a job interview next week. I'm feeling a little uneasy about it.",
  "Yeah, I'm definitely excited for it",
  "Interviews can be nerve wrecking.",
  "I recently had a court date for child support.",
  "The other party didn't show up so they put out a warrant for him. I don't have to go back now.",
  "They always do and then we start all over again. It's sad.",
  "Yikes, that must of been a bit scary. How did it go?",
  "That's something at least. I hope they catch him.",
  "I am ok with being fat.",
  "I weight more than I should.",
  "It shouldn't matter what you look like, but why would you think you are fat?",
  "I am excited for baseball playoffs. Are you?",
  "I love the Yankees.",
  "I watch it sometimes, It can be a little slow moving for my taste.",
  "I had jury duty for three months this spring. Its was surprisingly fun and interesting.",
  "It can be an inconvenience and it only paid 12 dollars a day. So that was bad.",
  "I hate jury duty.",
  "Yes. They underpay.",
  "I can't believe it hasn't rained today.",
  "Yes we need rain.",
  "Yes, so are you having nice weather,or is it too dry and need some rain?",
  "We have had some big rain storms this spring and summer. The creek behind my house got in my yard twice. Very scary.",
  "Not this time. But it did a little bit in 2009. and the mud and mess was unbelievably hard to clean up.",
  "oh no! that's scary! The house didn't get flooded, right?",
  "i'm sorry to hear that!",
  "Ugh I was so mad the other day, I went to the store and was grocery shopping. When I came out, I noticed my car was very scratched on the back bumper. I was so furious and angry, and I still am.",
  "No! That's the worst part. I can understand if someone left a note to say sorry. But no :(",
  "That's actually so frustrating! No note left on your car or anything from the other driver?",
  "Sorry to hear, I really hope that it doesn't cost to much to fix that up.",
  "I'm still kinda bummed about this, but like a month or more back I was really into this girl from Tinder and we started dating too. Unfortunately, after like 4 or 5 days, she said she wanted to stop dating and hasn't spoken to me since.",
  "It's fine, I'm feeling a lot better about it. The thing that irks me is that she went from super happy about dating to literally ending it and ghosting me in so little time. Makes me think it was all fake, but I can't think why she would do it.",
  "Oh no, that really sucks. That's awful that she wanted to end things, especially since you were really into her. I am sorry.",
  "We had a really good time on our vacation a couple of weeks ago.",
  "We went to Disney world with some friends who had never been before. We are passholders so we have been several times, but it was fun getting to see it throught the eyes of someone who had never been before.",
  "We had a great time! We both have small kids so they loved playing together, and it was nice to get to help show our friends the ropes and all the 'secrets' lol",
  "Thats sound nice. I went on vacation to Thailand last week. What did you do?",
  "I know what that feels like. It must have been exciting!",
  "Acting as a 'mentor' in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better!",
  "It was a really bad experience. Especially since I wasted all the ingredients!",
  "Yes, it was my nephew's birthday party pizza. And I promised him I would make his favorite pepperoni pizza!",
  "We had to order from a fast food chain! It wasn't bad, but fair to say, my nephew was disappointed in me.",
  "Oh no, was it an important meal?",
  "That's so sad! What did you end up doing instead?",
  "What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?",
  "I was very afraid in airplane because of severe turbulence.",
  "I was not able to cope with it. I had a severe panic attack.",
  "Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it?",
  "It is something that was really important to her, and I still feel bad that I missed her 15th birthday",
  "My cousin, she really wanted me to attend her party since she enjoys my cooking and I had planned on making cookies",
  "Who is she?",
  "Hi! One time when driving on fresh snow I almost wiped out into a ditch, that scared me",
  "I did end up being okay, but man was I nervous and shaking",
  "That does sound scary! Were you okay?",
  "I really enjoyed taking care of my nephew yesterday. His mother had left him with me since she had work.",
  "I agree. We just played xbox and had snacks. I feel he really enjoyed his time.",
  "That can be a fun time, it is nice to watch kids sometimes",
  "My brother applied for an Ivy League school this year, and we just found out he was accepted!",
  "Yeah, it was vey exciting news, I'm so proud of him.",
  "Nice, I am glad to hear about that",
  "I am trying to sell my house for 89k dollars, I have been in a bad financial situation, my nephew knows it, and now he is trying to buy my house just for 75k, trying to take advance of my situation",
  "I have no idea, I guess his husband is evil",
  "me too, and do you know what makes me mad? When I had a good job, I helped them a lot, and now they are trying to do this to me",
  "I know, right? My own nephew trying to do this with me",
  "Wow, that's terrible. Why would he do that to you?",
  "I'm sorry you're having to go through that, I hope you're able to sell the home for a better price.",
  "That's just terrible. Some people really are ungrateful.",
  "My brother graduated high school, I was very proud of him!",
  "It is, somewhat common, but still, I am proud of him all the same!",
  "I know that feel, my brother graduated a year ago, it's a really big milestone.",
  "I finished all my finals a couple of months ago for my sophomore year of college.",
  "It really was, I was scared I would fail but I ended up passing all my classes and even doing well in most of them, I was over joyed.",
  "That must have been a burden lifted for sure!",
  "Havent had any rain lately in my area. I hope we do soon, I live near a mountain and we have bad fires when it is dry.",
  "Yes, It has its drawbacks too, like making the grass grow, lol",
  "That's a shame, since rain is really nice to watch and hear even disregarding the dryness over there.",
  "Very true, well hopefully you get some anyway!",
  "It really irritates me when my friend acts superior to everyone in the room, since he seems to think he is the best looking and strongest guy ever when really he's not at all.",
  "That wouldn't surprise me. He has always been a bit insecure.",
  "That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem in ones self I believe.",
  "I have always been faithful to my girlfriend, I am proud of that in a way",
  "That is good and sadly rare these days",
  "that's wonderful! i've never cheated on my husband either",
  "i really want to lose weight. i know i can do it",
  "yes, and i'm very motivated",
  "I am sure you can, it just takes dedication and effort is all!",
  "I was chased by a pitbull as a child, I was so scared for years afterwards",
  "I was a fast kid so I got away, but I had heard how hard they bite",
  "that is so scary! you didn't get hurt, right?",
  "i'm so glad you did'nt get hurt",
  "I remember waiting for the Nintendo Switch to come out, I was so excited",
  "Awesome, I have Zelda, Mario, Splatoon, Fortnite and tons of other games!",
  "Me neither, too bad it is far away, but we still get smash and Pokemon this year!",
  "I was also excited. In fact, I have one right now!",
  "Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime.",
  "Hi! Have you been watching the FIFA World Cup recently?",
  "Yes, I was devastated to learn that because England are my favorite team!",
  "I have not, I did hear that England lost recently though.",
  "I heard they were doing great before the loss though, hope you at least got to see them in some good matches.",
  "I slipped while carrying a tray of coffee at work the other day, got it all over me.",
  "Yeah, I was fine. I bit embarrassed, but fine. Had to go home and change though. It was huge mess.",
  "Oh no, sorry to hear that! Were you okay?",
  "my parents picked me up from work in a new car for me when I turned 17, I was so surprised",
  "I was very excited, just to have a car at all is awesome!",
  "Did this make you excited?",
  "I still my miss my partner, they left me all alone.",
  "I hope so to, never thought this would happen, we were suppose to get a house together.",
  "I am sorry to hear that, maybe things will work themselves out!",
  "I feel bad, I hope you find someone who treats you even better!",
  "When I was in preschool, my pants fell down in front of everyone",
  "I got laughed at a lot and sat down haha",
  "That sounds embarrassing, what happened after?",
  "When I was younger my dad scared me and my brothers so bad I almost peed myself!",
  "When I was younger my dad scared me and my brothers so bad I almost peed myself!",
  "No, I was too young, I just about cried though",
  "What a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?",
  "hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?",
  "When I was younger, my grandmother passed away, I was so upset",
  "Thank you, I hope nothing ever happens to them!",
  "I loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so I understand how you feel.",
  "There's been a big white wolf or coyote around my yard the past few months. I'm afraid he will kill the neighbors cats.",
  "I don't know. I had a cute beaver and there was just a head and eyes left of some small animal that looked like him left in my yard. ugh.",
  "That is scary, what are you going to do about it?",
  "Wow that is sad, I hope you get that fixed",
  "My friend recently invited me to his wedding. I hadn't even known he was engaged, but it was a great wedding.",
  "Not too big, maybe 30 guests. He and his now wife have been together for only a year or so, so they set the whole thing up pretty quickly.",
  "That's fun, my friend is getting married next year, how big was the wedding?",
  "My dad used to be a pretty heavy drinker, it caused a few problems in our familiy.",
  "Yes he finally stopped drinking a few years ago, I was very proud of him and was able to have a real relationship with him.",
  "That is very sad, did he ever get sober?",
  "I don't really know how to react to this, but one of my friends told me a few days ago that not only is he going to Samoa for a while (which didn't surprise me because he and his family go to Africa all the time), but he's staying and moving there for a few years.",
  "I think it's because he dropped out of school here and doesn't have much reason to stay in America, since he can start a new life over there. Kinda makes me sad though, I didn't expect it at all.",
  "Wow, that's quite a move. Did he say why he's staying in Samoa so long?",
  "I broke a vase at my mom's house last year, and ended up hiding the evidence. I still haven't told her, and I feel bad about it.",
  "It was fairly expensive. She wasn't relly using it for anything, and hasn't noticed it's gone. I think I'm going to buy a replacement for her, and let her know I broke the old one.",
  "Oh man that's a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value, or was it really expensive or what?",
  "I meant my DOG got into rat poison and died. It was a truly horrific accident.",
  "He was a little over 8 years old so not long enough!",
  "Yes that's true. Now I am A LOT more careful about where I put rat poison.",
  "No, and it happened very fast. I started seeing symptoms and he died the next day even after I took him to the vet.",
  "Wow that is terrible, I hope he got to live a long life before that happened.",
  "Thats terrible, at least he wasnt a puppy I guess.",
  "I can imagine you would be, wouldnt want that to happen again.",
  "My friend got a huge scholarship when he barely passed the PSAT.",
  "Its mainly an English based test and hes really good at english",
  "Yea he was about 1 point above the cutoff, I was quite jealous of him to be honest, I barely didnt make it sadly.",
  "OU, he ended up dropping out to pursue writing about a year and a half in and wasted the scholarship.",
  "How did he manage to do that?",
  "I mean you said he barely passed it though. Must have been slim pickings when it came to giving out the sholarships.",
  "What college did he end up going to?",
  "I was pretty strapped for money back before my freshman year of college, so I really needed to get my 29 on my ACT up to a 31 for a scholarship.",
  "I felt super confident that I'd get the 31, and thankfully I was right since I got a 33!",
  "Did you get it done?",
  "My friend stole some of my money the other week.",
  "About $50, they even confessed and paid me back, but it was still depressing they didnt just ask first, I wouldve given him the money.",
  "That is really awful. Did they take very much?",
  "I was so nervous going to the dentist today, I thought I would pass out!",
  "I suppose so, I much needed tooth is repaired now so my anxiety really was for nothing.",
  "Oh no, did it end up okay?",
  "So yeah this Log even hit me square in the face and i ran out of the car.",
  "Dude the doctor and my parents thought the same thing.",
  "Nah, I did have shards of glass on me for a couple of days even after taking showers.",
  "Wow, it's a wounder you did not get killed!",
  "Do you have any lasting damage?",
  "It was really annoying when I was thinking I would room with my brother back in freshman year of college, but it didn't work out as planned.",
  "Definitely. It was just some random guy, and he was really incompatible with me too so it was really frustrating that they didn't room us together.",
  "It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate ,I bet.",
  "We moved to a new house last year and love it - and have spend much less working on projects and more time with the kids.",
  "Absolutely, and the time taken to becmoe experts on home repair is rather large.",
  "That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it, ultimately.",
  "So i had some anger management issues as a kid. Makes me feel dumb thinking back.",
  "Yeah, being a lot calmer is nice and well less stress really.",
  "I did too, honestly. I have really improved them myself, good to hear that you have too.",
  "I had my first real drink back in October with some of my friends and I was really nervous about it.",
  "It does, but I had never tried anything like drugs or alcohol before so I didn't know what to expect.",
  "Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun.",
  "I can't help but feel bad, since my friend has met a really good girl for him and I'm happy for him, but I wish I was in a good relationship too you know?",
  "Exactly, I am happy for him but I can't help but feel that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I hear about it. Still kinda makes me feel like a bad person.",
  "I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too",
  "When I won the honor society president election I was so confident in myself!",
  "I beat someone way more popular, that is what made it surprising to me",
  "I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.",
  "The other day my kids were being bad and I didn't feel well and I yelled at them. I felt guilty afterwards.",
  "Yes, but there are other ways to discipline them then yelling. I hurt their feelings.",
  "I would not, they have to learn at some point!",
  "I get that, but it was bound to happn at some point",
  "My parents bought me a car when i turned 17, i was so surprised",
  "I still own it actually, still running!",
  "You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it?",
  "I was shocked when I got a new car. My parents surprised me so well",
  "my birthday!",
  "Damn, I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion?",
  "One time I was at this party and a girl started to get really touchy feely and flirting with me, but I had a girlfriend at the time.",
  "I was way too close to my girlfriend to do anything, so I just let her know that I was in a relationship so that she wouldn't get the wrong idea.",
  "what did you do?",
  "So, I asked my 7 year old what 12x12 was the other day, and he gave me the correct answer without hesitation.",
  "Thanks, I'm really proud of him. We homeschool so I guess I'm doing something right!",
  "That's impressive, sounds like a smart young man.",
  "Man the first ever console i owned personally was a gamecube. Was so surprised getting it was funny what my parents did.",
  "I didn't get Mario until late was Sonic adventures 2, Parents hid the console in the bathroom with the game and told me to go clean the bathroom.",
  "Ahh yes, must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it?",
  "I still remember my high school days, I was a terrific athlete during that time.",
  "The runner's marathon. I felt so proud when I came in second place because I had trained for many months for it!",
  "What athletics did you participate in?",
  "My brother graduated high school, I was proud of him",
  "2017, I was there, it was awesome!",
  "When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him.",
  "A month or two ago my girlfriend randomly broke up with me and I had no idea that she was even close to considering that.",
  "It wasn't a great time, but it just really irked me since I had no idea that she was not into me at that time. She must've been really good at faking it.",
  "I am very sorry to hear that, that must be terrible....",
  "I reconnected with one of my childhood friends and I even got to go to the house that we used to hang out in years and years ago.",
  "You should, especially if you truly miss any of your childhood friends. It was a surreal but amazing experience.",
  "That is something I want to do when I get older, I miss the golden days!",
  "My grandmother passed away when I was a child, it really upset me",
  "I am happy for you, I hope that continues",
  "That's tragic, I haven't had to deal with anything like that yet.",
  "I have a girlfriend, and I will never cheat on her",
  "Absolutely, not even a doubt",
  "So your saying your faithful and love her.",
  "So i am really happy with myself lately. Finally graduated college after 8 years since 2009.",
  "Yeah it felt tough every year that passed but i got that degree man.",
  "Wow, go you! I am proud of you, it can be tough to do!",
  "I have a girlfriend, and I would never cheat on her",
  "I agree, I am not sure how people can do that to each other",
  "That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship.",
  "My sister is coming from France to visit us. I am happy to see her again.",
  "No, I am not. It is exciting. It has been almost a year since I saw her.",
  "How exciting, are you from France?",
  "I started working out again and it was nerveracking to begin again.",
  "It's been over 10 years since i've worked out!",
  "Great. How long did you stop working out?",
  "It is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.",
  "This morning I was running late for work, and I got so mad at the driver in front of me!",
  "No, but I do hate those, too! We were in bumper to bumper traffic, and this woman is putting on her makeup. She doesn't notice when the car in front of her moves, and we miss the light. Ugh!",
  "Was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65?",
  "The question is, did the woman at least do a good job ( from what you could see)?",
  "It made me feel really disappointed when my CV got rejected in the first place.",
  "Well it took some time for me to cope up because I really put a lot of efforts, however I got to understand that it should be rather taken as a learning experience",
  "How did you respond after rejection?",
  "Yes, you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise",
  "My finances are not the greatest lately and I've been so worried. I haven't been sleeping due to stressing about this situation.",
  "Thank you! I'm working through it and I have come up with several solutions to this debt problem.",
  "I am sorry to hear that, I hope things turn around for you soon!",
  "I am glad to hear that, I hope they work out for you!",
  "I ate my coworkers food recently, I feel bad but they left it there for awhile",
  "I ate their wings and so it was kinda hard to hide because my fingers were orange.... whoops",
  "HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them?",
  "I beat my classmate in a school election, even though she was way more popular",
  "Thank you, I appreciate it!",
  "omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future",
  "I went to florida one time and saw a childhood friend there, that was a surprise!",
  "It sure is, what are the odds...",
  "You are right.Florida is a big state with lot's of people.",
  "I am surprised England Lost to Croatia on the World Cup.I tought they were gonna win easily",
  "Did you watched the game? The Croatians were warriors out there.",
  "I am shocked too, Croatia only has 4 millio people",
  "Yeaah they really were, number 12 killed it with that goal",
  "My parents let me live in their house for free, I am realy thankful",
  "Yeaaah, I know a lot of people who struggle with bills.",
  "I feel that man, Parents like that care for their family a lot.",
  "I remember a time i got my first retail job. Was scared about the interview but after just taking a deep breath. I just felt like i owned the place.",
  "You ever just get those moment where you shake it off and the confident feeling flows in.",
  "I know that feeling, good for you!",
  "So i felt bad once because i broke my parents fax machine. What made me feel bad even more he got angry.",
  "Yeah he did but i felt bad cause he threw the fax machine into the kitchen. This was a heavy machine by the way.",
  "well he did have a right to be angry (depending on how you broke it ofc)",
  "I have a met with an accident once. one gentlemen saved my life",
  "Yeah i did. I have visited him once i was up and running. He was so chuffed see me breathing",
  "I am glad to hear that, did you repay him?",
  "That is good to hear, I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster",
  "I was angry when my brother ruined the result of a football game. I recorded it to watch later",
  "I am glad I do, I just wish they could shutup sometimes haha",
  "sibling fights worth living for.. I wish i had one.",
  "I am so excited. Tomorrow is my birthday",
  "Thanks. I can't wait for tomorrow for the party and the presents",
  "Well happy early birthday! I hope you have a great day!",

  "I do luckily, and a great girlfriend, so things work out in the end",
  "Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now?",
  "\"I am so proud about myself. I just got promoted at my firm.",
  "You have no idea. I have been waiting 3 years for that promotion.",
  "Good job! I am sure that took a lot of hard work!",
  "playing my gameboy makes me nostalgic. i love pokemon emerald the most",
  "I still have my one from when I was young, it is in good shape",
  "Me to. I also play gameboy from time to time",
  "Someone rear ended me a few months ago. I was very upset because I had places to be",
  "I was okay, but my car got a bit messed up",
  "That is so aggravating! I've been in the exact same situation. I hope you weren't hurt.",
  "I was terrifified when my dad scared me as a kid. I have to admit he was good at it",
  "I turned out okay, but for some people it certainly might",
  "I believe this kind of a rude attitude by parents leave an impression on the kid's growth",
  "I was really fascinated by Skiing and though about taking lessons to make it easy for me.",
  "Yeah it's an amazing experience altogether. I really enjoy the sport.",
  "I wish I could afford lessons or to even try, I bet it is really fun!",
  "I do like to watch it in the olympics or sure though!",
  "I hope the nintendo switch get madden on it. I love portable football games",
  "I feel that one deep in my core, I want it ten times more then",
  "I like them too. I like to play football games while I'm eating Chik-Fil-A, but I always want to go on Sundays when they're closed.",
  "I'm so happy about going to the lake with my wife, it makes me burst with joy!",
  "I'm planning to relax, maybe even swim, sit near the water. I love swimming!",
  "That sounds like fun! What are you planning to do at the lake.",
  "It will be a great escape from regular life, right? How often do you get to go?",
  "My husband mowed the lawn today and repaired our back fence.",
  "Yes! Unfortunately, while working on the fence, he grabbed a board with a rough edge and cut his hand.",
  "Oh that's nice, you must have a hard-working husband.",
  "That sounds horrible. Was it serious?",
  "So favorite movie is Jurassic park and they had that ride at Universal. I loved that ride so much i was so hyper waiting in line.",
  "Yes! it was indeed my first time there even. So that was even more exciting.",
  "That sounds like fun! Was it your first time at Universal?",
  "I am working very hard at getting new business and I want people to trust me.",
  "I talk about my business to everyone at meetings and why it's important to use a travel agent and not go with the cheap guys online.",
  "We do! It's very time consuming looking on line. Even with the cruise lines I'm going to get better deals and better cabin space for a client",
  "Those are both admirable ideas. How are you trying to improve trust?",
  "Travel agents make complicated travel so much easier than using online sites.",
  "That's awesome. Best of luck to you with your business!",
  "No one showed up to my birthday part so I ate by myself at home.",
  "I wish! I did enjoy a good dinner, but it would have been nice if others were around to celebrate.",
  "Well, I like to think of it as an excuse to meet friends and family. Too bad I was away from family that day!",
  "I'm sorry to hear that! Happy Birthday! Hope you didn't eat the entire cake LOL!",
  "I decided not to celebrate birthdays anymore now that I'm old!",
  "A few years ago, I was out hiking, and almost stepped on a rattlesnake. Thank goodness it alerted!",
  "It took me a minute to figure out what I was hearing, and then I back up VERY quickly!!",
  "Oh my goodness! That must have been frightening. What happened after it alerted?",
  "Where did the snake go?",
  "My last trip to the beach was amazing! I felt confident enough to wear a bikini!",
  "I did! I was celebrating having lost 20lbs! At first I was nervous, but then it was fun.",
  "That is awesome! I bet you had a great time!",
  "I am so happy. My grandmother is getting out of the hospital.",
  "Yes, she is. She having issues with her heart. She needed a chirurgical operation.",
  "That's awesome. Is she better?",
  "I hope the immigrants children get reunited with their families",
  "Yes, it is.This problem in the border is very complex and emotive",
  "Same. It is just a devasting thing that is happening.",
  "I was a student in undergraduate school when this happened.",
  "When I was applying to physical therapy school.",
  "When what happened?",
  "What was the issue that plagued you?",
  "My co-worker got the promotion I had my eye on it.I am so mad and jealous.",
  "I work in Banking and insurance. I have more experience than him.",
  "Damn, that sucks. What field do you work in?",
  "This past chrstmas, I was gifted my HP laptop, and I have been consistently using it ever since! It really was a great gift.",
  "Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit.",
  "That's such a nice gift! What are your main uses of it?",
  "So i had this annoying little cousin. He went into my room when i wasn't there and got my computer fried because he spilled coke on the desk and into the computer.",
  "I lost a lot of my data i used school at the time. I was really mad at him.",
  "That's not good at all. Did you lose any important data?",
  "I had an interview last week for a part-time-job and I hope I get it it. I have been an unemployed student for 6 months and the work would help!",
  "No, it is unrelated to my career field and temporary work. Thanks for the good vibes. Waiting to hear back from an interview is nerve racking!",
  "I will send all the good vibes! Is it in a field you could see yourself making a career of?",
  "I am so annoyed that France is in the world cup final. I do not like their style of play",
  "They are to defensive.Their games are so boring.",
  "What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of?",
  "I am so surprised Roger Federer lost yesterday at Wimbledon. he is the GOAT of tennis.",
  "He is the best player ever.He won the mos grand slams titles.",
  "I'm not too familiar with Tennis, Is he known to be a winner?",
  "When my wife and I got married, we knew we wanted to have kids. When we found out that we were expecting, the only thing on our mind for the longest time was if we were having a boy or a girl.",
  "We did! We were living in Japan at the time, and we were paying this clinic 2000 yen a week so we could keep getting ultrasounds of the baby.",
  "At the time, the exchange rate was about 110 yen to the dollar, so it was pretty affordable, and worth it to keep going back.",
  "I wouldn't be able to tell you, since I wasn't under their healthcare system. This was just a women's clinic that offered this service pretty cheaply.",
  "What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was?",
  "What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?",
  "It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America, do you agree?",
  "I'm so happy and relieved my mom came to my rescue this week.",
  "She offered to help me out financially with something that was really stressing me out.",
  "I fell off the back porch steps and broke my wrist. It required surgery.",
  "Moms are good at doing that, aren't they? What did she do for you?",
  "I know that feeling! What's been getting to you?",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you make a speedy recovery!",
  "You tend to feel really low when you travel frequently. I believe it's because you miss family & friends",
  "Yeah, it's mainly for client site assignments that I have to travel !",
  "It's always interesting to travel to Europe or the Western countries because you have a lot more to do! However quite often I have been travelling to Africa as well.",
  "yes, especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work?",
  "Where do you go the most?",
  "In the other hand, I am excited to go to Vegas tomorrow",
  "This is my first time going there. I want to try my luck",
  "Wow ! that sound's really awesome. I wish I could have gone there. But surely not for work !",
  "Last night, I had ths crazy realistic dream that I was riding around on a motorcycle. At one point, I hit a quick sharp turn, and felt like I nearly had just fell off. It was so realistic and frightening.",
  "Possibly, my dreams are often very confusing and or lonely. It is very sad. I think I need a lifestyle change, or am just too stressed at night.",
  "Maybe something in your life makes you very stress. You should try to relax before go to sleep.",
  "He just took his lunch box, have a last look at me and said : I hope they will be nice.",
  "Not sad at all. He was so happy, but of course a little bit anxious.",
  "That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that.",
  "That's terrible! I suppose sometimes things backfire, no matter how good our intentions are.",
  "They tried to make out I was bad at my job, that's the last time I'll give somebody a heads up at my own expense again.",
  "I sure did, thankfully I've been there a lot longer so they know me well enough.",
  "It did, but it could have ended very badly for me or even have resulted in me losing my job.",
  "What happened?",
  "Oh, no. That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job?",
  "Yeah, that's good. It's hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. I'm glad that it sounds like it worked out.",
  "I lost my best friend last year when he moved to Chicago because he got accepted into a master's program, and he made me feel like our friendship meant nothing since he was going on to do bigger and better things.",
  "We don't really stay in touch anymore. He and his fiance invited me to their wedding, though. He's not a social media person, and I'm not either, so we've basically lost touch. I haven't filled the void, unfortunately, but I feel okay about it now.",
  "Maybe it will. I'm not sure, but I feel more happy for him now than I do envious and hurt. So, whatever happens, happens. It's okay.",
  "That can be pretty hard to swallow, do you stay in touch? It's easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void?",
  "That's such a shame, we grieve any kind of loss, I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together?",
  "I am so exited about the coming world cup final.It is going to be a very exiting game",
  "The world is the biggest sports competition worldwide, right after the Olympics.",
  "I'm not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape!",
  "Yes, I'm aware, but i'm a much bigger hockey fan.",
  "I am so disgust at Donald Trump and his immigration policies.",
  "It's coming form a traitor, you mean",
  "I do not care about other parts of the world.I care about how my country treats immigrants.",
  "I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American.",
  "How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe? You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here.",
  "So you ever get those moments when you look like a idiot for not understanding what someone meant earlier.",
  "Yeah when i was going to drive friends home i thought they were in my car at first but they wanted to ride on our way to the next place we were going.",
  "It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you?",
  "I usually study hard and get my grades but sometimes it doesnt work out.",
  "Yep, basically my brain just abandoned me at the critical moment. I was so disappointed.",
  "Brain just wants to work against you?",
  "I recently broke up with my girlfriend and i feel so lonely.",
  "They are trying, but they all are in relationships right now, so it is very difficult.",
  "Oh, man. That's rough. I'm sorry. Are friends helping?",
  "I won $50,000 on one of the 3 scratch off tickets I recently bought!",
  "I know! I normally do not win so I could not believe it when I did!",
  "Holy smokes - thats unbelievable. I gave up on playing those scratch off games",
  "I started feeling a little anxious when my GPS just shut off",
  "yes, I was traveling to my daughters new house",
  "Were you using it to get to a specific place?",
  "I'm hopefully that their will be peace in this world.",
  "True, just don't like how the world is inching toward a conflict that could spill over to a nuclear war.",
  "I am hopeful as well, but because we are human beings, I doubt that will ever happen. There will always be the same old squabbles that have occurred since the dawn of man.",
  "Yeah, sadly our world leaders are too focused on \"flexing\" instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and liveable for our grandchildren's children",
  "I went into the old abandoned house went and spent the night.",
  "Well i started hearing footsteps and voice it was so scary.",
  "That's sad. Sorry you had to go through that.",
  "I started my first government job two years ago.",
  "It feels amazing to know that I've surpassed people that thought I would fail.",
  "How do you feel now after so long being there?",
  "Last year, we had a trying experience during Hurricane Irma, but came out OK.",
  "At first, there were no supplies. But yes, we ended up OK.",
  "That must have been terrible. Were you okay?",
  "I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK.",
  "Ever have those days when everything just goes wrong?",
  "Well if you're curious, I was on my way to work when my car broke down and I ended up missing a very important meeting about my promotion. I was devastated.",
  "Yes, many. Would you like to tell me about it?",
  "During college, I was bullied.",
  "No, it was terrible period for me. There was sometime that could sleep a full night.",
  "That is terrible. Were you able to do anything about it?",
  "Last year, my family went on vacation and left me all alone.",
  "Yes. I tried distracting myself with tv and internet, but i kept thinking of them.",
  "That is terrible. Did you feel lonely?",
  "How long did you stay alone?",
  "My kid was fast enough to be a master of snowboarding after taking only few lessons last winters!",
  "I believe the sooner you start the better it is ! It also depends upon your passion for the sport.",
  "That is pretty great! I am actually still a beginner with snowboarding.",
  "I feel for me it's just getting to the slopes more often too.",
  "So i like being prepared for a lot of different situations when i go to conventions.",
  "Yeah, I think the most important thing to me is the first aid kit.",
  "True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up",
  "I'm anticipating a very warm summer here in Dallas.",
  "No I hate you can't do anything outside and are trapped indoor its not nice. The only thing that I do is swim in my pool and cool off.",
  "Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat?",
  "A few weeks ago, we had a terrible storm, and my apartment flooded.",
  "None of my or the landlord's insurance covered the damage, so he's paying for the repairs out of pocket.",
  "Not really, the repairs were supposed to take three days, and it's taken over three weeks so far.",
  "Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!",
  "Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!",
  "I went back though my old high school as part of a reunion. It brought back many memories.",
  "Yeah, most of the were. I think we forget the awkward stuff. On the other hand, I'm not sure I would want to do it again.",
  "Were they fond memories?",
  "By mistake, I saw an image of a car accident. I was disgusted.",
  "Yes, the image keep coming back. Terrible.",
  "Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic?",
  "My boyfriend cheated on me while I was away visiting family. I was very angry and upset",
  "No, we are working on sorting things out but I am still very hurt.",
  "Sorry to hear about that. Did you ask him to move out of the house?",
  "Did you know the person who was with him?",
  "Hey, I was at this talent show recently. I saw this guy playing a whole song by himself it was crazy.",
  "Yeah it was Ride the Lightning by Metallica, which made it even more impressive because it's a very technical and fast song.",
  "What song was it? Did you know it?",
  "I am pretty much the IT guy among my friends. Always ready to fix computers for them.",
  "Yeah, you sorta feel like the specialist among your friends and loved ones.",
  "I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too, it's very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes.",
  "I missed up on something, but was told I could redo it",
  "Not yet I'm still waiting for the email with the new info",
  "Did you take that chance and redo it?",
  "I was tired the other day at work because my boyfriend kept me up all night. So annoying.",
  "Video games! How did you know?",
  "I know that pain! Did he keep you up watching tv or video games?",
  "My boss called me the other day to tell me I would be receiving a package the next day. No other info, but she told me not to open it until I called her.",
  "Yep! I was hoping it was a special award that my company give to deserving employees. Turns out it was just some HR paperwork that she needed to go over with me regarding my team. Boo!",
  "So have you gotten to open it yet??",
  "So the other day I ate a piece of cake that my mom made for my dad as a gift, oops.",
  "Unfortunately he walked in right as I took the last bite! Fortunately it all worked out so no harm done.",
  "Oh no! Well what he didn't know won't hurt him. Hopefully you can get a replacement.",
  "I recently had to put my cat, Blackjack, to sleep.",
  "He was 15 and his kidneys were failing. It was really hard for me and my kids.",
  "Since he was 4 months old. It was so hard, but the right thing to do.",
  "Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us.",
  "I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?",
  "It was a hot summer day and the sirens went off in the grocery store. I was about to leave the grocery store until the lady next to me with 2 kids stopped me to ask if I can assist her. I carried one of her kids out of the grocery store. It seemed that she felt comfortable around me.",
  "I like to help others! It was not an easy thing to do, but it seemed like it was the right thing to do.",
  "Wow! You must have a very trusting face! That was very nice of you to help her.",
  "It definitely was! How old do you think her kids were?",
  "I am afraid of the upcoming economic crisis in the USA.It will affect all of us.",
  "yes. I am saving all i can for when the storm comes.",
  "I almost don't want to talk about it, you know? Are you doing anything to try to move from a place of fear to one of preparation or opportunity?",
  "Good for you. And I hope you have moments of joy while you prepare for that?",
  "Last year, i went to a restaurant and they had a pinball machine.",
  "I did. It took me back to my childhood.",
  "Did you play it?",
  "That sounds so fun! I\"m glad you enjoyed it!",
  "I saw a homeless man sweating in the sun the other day.",
  "I was empathetic. It also make me feel thankful for my blessings.",
  "I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight.",
  "I made plans to spend time with my friend Megan today, and unfortunately, I had to reschedule yet again.",
  "Of course, she's my best friend. I just feel bad that I had to bail on her for the third time in a row.",
  "That's unfortunate. Do you like her?",
  "I am sorry. Did you set up another day to hang out?",
  "The other day I met up with some friends I hadn't seen in a while",
  "We went to a new restaurant none of us had ever been to. It was fun!",
  "What did you and your friends do on that day?",
  "I was attacked in the street by someone who stole my bag. I was so scared that I had a panic attack.",
  "Yes, I did but I am still shocked.",
  "Oh no, did you report it to the police?",
  "So last year I let my friend borrow my car, and that night he ended up crashing and totaling it. I was crushed.",
  "Well I had insurance, but he was driving so it wasn't covered. He's been paying me back bit by bit.",
  "No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything?",
  "So lately my most fun experience I've had was when the Capitals won the Stanley cup finally.",
  "Yep since i was 3! Was a nice time the streets of DC flooded with people celebrating a championship finally for the team.",
  "That is exciting when your team wins, have you always been a hockey fan?",
  "When my daughter was born I was so happy and excited.",

  "It was a huge upset.The England team was the favorite.",
  "Wow I did not know that!",
  "Oh no. Were you upset as well?",
  "Have you ever been really disappointed?",
  "For sure! Last year I was really hoping to get this one fellowship but it didn't pan out...but I got back up and kept on working hard!",
  "Not for now, decided to finish up my PhD...it'll be tough but I think I can be done in 1 year or so!",
  "Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments, I think it's how we respond that defines us, you know?",
  "Probably even harder! Is there another fellowship you have your eye on?",
  "I thought my girlfriend was pregnant recently.",
  "It made me feel very scared not knowing what would happen.",
  "Oh really? How did that make you feel, honestly?",
  "One time on a date I tripped right at the end and fell right on my face...the worst",
  "It was a third date! But now I have been with her for the past 2.5 years :) So it wasn't too bad!",
  "Oh no! Was it a first date? Or had you been out with this person before?",
  "That's so sweet. Do you laugh about the situation now together?",
  "One night, i hugged my wife and told her i loved her",
  "I went to work and got a big raise. I rushed home to tell her.",
  "Aww! That's so sweet! How long have you been married?",
  "That's very exciting! Congratulations on your raise!",
  "The other day I was babysitting my 2 year old nephew and he tried to do a flip off the couch headfirst onto the floor!",
  "I did! By one leg! Three inches before his head hit the tile! I almost had a heart attack!",
  "Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!",
  "My coworkers threw a party for me recently.",
  "My birthday. I didn't even think they liked me.",
  "That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion?",
  "I recently thought I saw a ghost in my house.",
  "My bedroom! I was horrified!",
  "Where did you see it?",
  "I had a really difficult time handling the 10th grade.",
  "Well I think the teachers in my state don't care enough to teach in a way that I understood.",
  "What made it so difficult?",
  "I am so happy that France is going to the final of the soccer world cup",

  "Wonderful! Your team I guess? That's exciting!",
  "I have a huge meeting coming up soon at work.",
  "it is for a major project that I am leading. I am fairly well prepared, but I just don't know for sure how it is going to go.",
  "What is it about?",
  "I think the best day of my life was when i got a car for graduation. The day started with my mom giving me hints and such. I was wondering but thought it wasnt possible so I just refocused.",
  "It was so geb=nerous and unexpected. Im sure you can give in ways people will love.",
  "A saturn",
  "That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.",
  "You're right, and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?",
  "I was so upset the other day. I came home and my refrigerator was broken.",
  "Yes. Not only did I have to pay $1400 for a new one, I had to throw away all my food.",
  "That is such a stressful thing to come home to!",
  "I recently went back to my home state to visit.",
  "Yes I did. It made me think of the past. It was bittersweet.",
  "Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family?",
  "I was so thrilled with my gift for my 9th birthday!",
  "It sure was. It was a Super Nintendo which was epic because we were very poor back then.",
  "You still remember what you got for it? It must have been memorable! What was it?",
  "I had way too many beers last night, and stayed up a lot later than I had planned.",
  "Probably just before 6am, and I had to wake up for work at 9:30, so needless to say, I called out this morning.",
  "Oh wow, what time did you end up getting to bed?",
  "I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight.",
  "I am old and in good health, but death is around the corner.",
  "That is riduculous. Death is inevitible.",
  "You shouldn't think about death! Take each day as it comes",
  "Thinking like that seems stressful",
  "I didnt get the assistant training position at my job, even though I have done better than the head trainer himself on the yearly test, 4 years in a row!",
  "yup, guess I need to practice my butt kissing",
  "Life is like that. It is not what you know but who you know.",
  "I couldn't believe it! When the battle started to swing my way I remember starting to get that feeling that I may win.",
  "I was playing 1v1 Starcraft on the competitive ladder.",
  "What battle? What were you doing?",
  "I had to give a speech at work and I forgot what I was saying right in the middle.",
  "No I did not, and everyone laughed at me. It was terrible.",
  "That's never fun. Did you have any notes to help you remember?",
  "I recently started in vitro treatments in hopes of getting pregnant.",

  "I'm so excited! But a little scared too. I hope I get it!",
  "Thank you! It's a customer service job, which I've done, but in a different industry.",
  "Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum? ;-)",
  "I am sending you all the best vibes. Is it in a field you've worked in before?",
  "\"I was so let down when i didnt get the last job i applied for.\".",
  "Its hard to know. If I had to guess I couldnt unfortunately.",
  "I've been in that boat. What do you think the issue was?",
  "I had to help my friend move out of their house",
  "It went ok, i was tired after",
  "how did that go?",
  "Was it a long move?",
