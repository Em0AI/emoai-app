What can you control right now?\n*   Make a study plan for the next 24 hours, and commit to following it. Sometimes, having a clear plan can help reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n*   Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. You can't possibly know everything, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person."}

Taking a few deep breaths can help calm your body and mind.\n2. **Reach out to a trusted friend or family member**: Talking to someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood. Even if it's just a quick phone call or text, it can make a big difference.\n3. **Do something that brings you small joy**: It might be as simple as taking a short walk, listening to your favorite music, or doing a small creative activity. Sometimes, focusing on small pleasures can help shift our mood.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and it's okay to feel sad and depressed. But it's also okay to reach out for help and support. Would you like to talk more about what's been going on and how I can support you?"}

It's natural to feel anxious about telling your family news, especially if you've always been seen as capable and successful. However, honesty is the best way to maintain trust in relationships. Consider the following steps to help you approach this conversation:\n\n1.  Choose the right time and place: Find a private and comfortable setting where both parties can talk without interruptions. This could be a quiet room in your home, a park bench, or even a local coffee shop.\n\n2.  Prepare your story: Be prepared to share your experiences honestly and openly. Explain how the situation happened and how it affects you. Avoid blaming or shaming yourself or others.\n\n3.  Use \"I\" statements: Instead of saying \"You think I have things figured out,\" say \"I always thought I had things figured out.\" This helps to shift the focus from your family's perception to your own feelings and experiences.\n\n4.  Offer solutions: Instead of just saying \"I got laid off,\" try to suggest ways you can move forward. For example, you could say, \"I was laid off, but I'm looking for new opportunities and I'm excited to see where this takes me.\"\n\n5.  Be patient: It's normal for your family to react emotionally. Be patient and understanding, and remind them that you're there to support them as well.\n\nRemember, open and honest communication is key to maintaining a strong relationship. Your family will likely come to understand your situation and will be there to support you through this challenging time."}
