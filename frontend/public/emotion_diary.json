While it's true that tech jobs can be competitive, they are still a viable option for many people, including those with a background in non-tech fields. Many companies are actively looking to hire people with diverse skill sets to fill their tech roles.\n\nTo increase your chances of landing a tech job, consider the following:\n\n1. Highlight your transferable skills: Even if you don't have direct tech experience, you may have skills that are relevant to the tech industry, such as problem-solving, teamwork, or communication. Make sure to highlight these skills in your resume.\n\n2. Pursue additional training: If you're not already proficient in coding or other tech skills, consider taking online courses or enrolling in a vocational program to gain these skills.\n\n3. Network: Attend industry events, join online forums, and connect with professionals in your desired field. This can help you learn more about the field and make connections that could lead to job opportunities.\n\n4. Be patient: It may take some time to find the right job, so be patient and persistent in your job search.\n\nRemember that this is a challenging time, but taking action and being proactive can help you move forward.

However, honesty is the best way to maintain trust in relationships. Consider the following steps to help you approach this conversation:\n\n1.  Choose the right time and place: Find a private and comfortable setting where both parties can talk without interruptions. This could be a quiet room in your home, a park bench, or even a local coffee shop.\n\n2.  Prepare your story: Be prepared to share your experiences honestly and openly. Explain how the situation happened and how it affects you. Avoid blaming or shaming yourself or others.\n\n3.  Use \"I\" statements: Instead of saying \"You think I have things figured out,\" say \"I always thought I had things figured out.\" This helps to shift the focus from your family's perception to your own feelings and experiences.\n\n4.  Offer solutions: Instead of just saying \"I got laid off,\" try to suggest ways you can move forward. For example, you could say, \"I was laid off, but I'm looking for new opportunities and I'm excited to see where this takes me.\"\n\n5.  Be patient: It's normal for your family to react emotionally. Be patient and understanding, and remind them that you're there to support them as well.\n\nRemember, open and honest communication is key to maintaining a strong relationship. Your family will likely come to understand your situation and will be there to support you through this challenging time."

Even if it's just a quick phone call or text, it can make a big difference.\n3. **Do something that brings you small joy**: It might be as simple as taking a short walk, listening to your favorite music, or doing a small creative activity. Sometimes, focusing on small pleasures can help shift our mood.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and it's okay to feel sad and depressed. But it's also okay to reach out for help and support. Would you like to talk more about what's been going on and how I can support you?"
